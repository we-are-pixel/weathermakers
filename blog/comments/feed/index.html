										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20200625152917-0a0b92e1-cu_e260x180.jpg"><img width="260" height="179" src="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20200625152917-0a0b92e1-cu_e260x180.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3090"/></a></figure></div>


<p>Discovering a leak in your water heater can be frustrating—and potentially damaging to your home. Left unchecked, even a small leak can lead to mold, structural damage, and higher utility bills. Whether it&#8217;s a small drip or a growing puddle, you need to act fast to prevent water damage and restore your hot water supply. If you’ve noticed your <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters">water heater leaking in Edmonton,</a> here’s what to do next to protect your home and your peace of mind.</p>



<span id="more-3081"></span>



<h2>Step 1: Shut Off the Water Supply</h2>



<p>First things first: locate the cold water shut-off valve on your water heater. It’s typically found above the unit. Turn it off to prevent more water from entering the tank and making the leak worse. If the valve is stuck or difficult to reach, you may need to shut off your home’s main water supply instead.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Turn Off the Power or Gas</h2>



<p>For electric water heaters, switch off the breaker labeled “water heater” in your electrical panel. If you have a gas model, turn the gas valve to the “off” position. This step is crucial for safety—leaks and electricity or gas don’t mix.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Identify the Source of the Leak</h2>



<p>Leaks can happen for a number of reasons. Some of the most common sources include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Loose drain valves</strong></li><li><strong>Corroded or cracked tank</strong></li><li><strong>A faulty temperature and pressure relief (T&amp;P) valve</strong></li><li><strong>Leaky plumbing connections</strong></li></ul>



<p>Carefully inspect the unit. If water is dripping from the top, it could be a fitting. If it’s pooling around the base, it may be the tank itself, especially if it’s over 10 years old.</p>



<h2>Step 4: Drain the Tank</h2>



<p>If the leak is significant or the tank is full, draining it can help prevent further water damage. Connect a garden hose to the drain valve at the bottom of the tank and run the hose outside or to a floor drain. Open the valve and allow the tank to empty.<br><br><strong>Important:</strong> Be cautious—water inside may still be hot. Let the unit cool before draining if needed.</p>



<h2>Step 5: Call a Professional</h2>



<p>Some minor leaks can be fixed with a quick repair, tightening a valve, or replacing a faulty part. But if the tank itself is corroded or cracked, replacement is likely the only safe and long-term solution. In many cases, calling a professional is the best route to ensure the issue is diagnosed and resolved correctly the first time.<br><br>That’s where we come in. At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we know how stressful plumbing issues can be, especially when they disrupt your daily routine. Our licensed technicians are experienced in diagnosing and repairing all types of water heater problems, and we’ll give you honest advice on whether it’s worth repairing or replacing your system.<br><br>We also offer 24/7 emergency plumbing service—because leaks don’t wait for a convenient time.</p>



<h2>Don’t Wait—Take Action Today</h2>



<p>A leaking water heater won’t fix itself—and the longer you wait, the more damage it can cause. From minor repairs to full replacements, we’re here to make sure you’re never without hot water when you need it most.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20240531110515-40e8f34f-cu_e260x180.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="259" height="180" src="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20240531110515-40e8f34f-cu_e260x180.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3077"/></a></figure></div>


<p>When the summer sun turns up the heat, your comfort at home becomes a top priority. If you&#8217;re exploring your cooling options and considering <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation">AC installation in Edmonton</a>, inverter air conditioners should be at the top of your list—and for good reason. At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we understand the importance of staying cool and energy-efficient all summer long. That’s why we recommend inverter ACs to our clients who want the best in performance, comfort, and savings.</p>



<span id="more-3067"></span>



<h2>What Makes Inverter ACs Different?</h2>



<p>Unlike traditional air conditioners that run on a simple on-off cycle, inverter ACs use advanced technology to adjust their compressor speed based on your cooling needs. This means they don&#8217;t have to power up and down constantly. Instead, they maintain a consistent temperature, giving you smoother, quieter, and more efficient performance. They also help maintain better humidity control, making your indoor environment feel fresher and less sticky even on the hottest days.<br><br>The result? A home that cools faster, stays cooler longer, and uses less energy, without the uncomfortable temperature swings that come with older AC systems.</p>



<h2>Energy Efficiency That Pays Off</h2>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of inverter ACs is their energy efficiency. Because they can regulate how much power they use depending on the situation, they consume significantly less electricity than non-inverter models. That means you’ll see a noticeable drop in your energy bills—even during those peak summer months when your AC is working hardest.<br><br>Plus, many inverter AC units are ENERGY STAR® certified, which not only helps reduce your carbon footprint but may also qualify you for local energy rebates.</p>



<h2>Quieter Operation, Better Sleep</h2>



<p>Have you ever been woken up in the middle of the night by your air conditioner clicking on? Inverter ACs operate at variable speeds, which significantly reduces noise. The smooth, steady airflow is ideal for bedrooms, nurseries, and other spaces where quiet is essential.</p>



<h2>Longer Lifespan, Fewer Repairs</h2>



<p>Inverter technology puts less strain on your system because it avoids the constant start-stop cycle of traditional ACs. This gentler operation helps extend the life of your unit and reduces wear and tear, meaning fewer service calls and lower maintenance costs over time. In the long run, this translates into real peace of mind, knowing your investment is built to last.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Edmonton’s Climate</h2>



<p>Edmonton summers can get hot, but they&#8217;re also unpredictable. Inverter ACs are great at adjusting quickly to changing temperatures, keeping your home comfortable no matter what the weather throws your way. When paired with professional AC installation in Edmonton, you’ll enjoy cooling that’s not just powerful, but smart.</p>



<h2>The Right Choice for Your Home</h2>



<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we believe your home deserves the best. That’s why we only install and recommend products we’d trust in our own homes. Inverter ACs offer unmatched benefits in terms of comfort, efficiency, and durability. If you&#8217;re thinking about upgrading your cooling system this summer, we’re here to help guide you through every step, from selection to expert installation.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we care deeply about your family’s comfort and safety, especially when it comes to silent dangers like carbon monoxide (CO). This colorless, odorless gas can quickly become life-threatening if undetected. Fortunately, with a few proactive steps, you can dramatically reduce the risk of exposure in your home. Here are simple, effective ways to protect your family and improve peace of mind.</p>



<span id="more-3053"></span>



<h2>1. Install Carbon Monoxide Detectors</h2>



<p>The first and most critical step is installing carbon monoxide detectors on every level of your home, particularly near sleeping areas. These life-saving devices alert you if CO levels become unsafe. Make sure to test them monthly and replace batteries every six months. If your detectors are more than seven years old, it’s time to replace them.</p>



<h2>2. Schedule Regular Furnace Maintenance</h2>



<p>Gas furnaces can cause a carbon monoxide leak if they’re not maintained properly. Annual inspections and tune-ups by qualified technicians ensure your system runs safely and efficiently. Our licensed team at WeatherMakers specializes in servicing all makes and models, helping you avoid unexpected leaks and costly repairs.</p>



<h2>3. Never Use Outdoor Appliances Indoors</h2>



<p>It might seem obvious, but using outdoor devices like BBQs, generators, or propane heaters inside your home or garage—even for a short time—can cause dangerous CO buildup. Always use these appliances outdoors and far away from doors, windows, and vents.</p>



<h2>4. Ensure Proper Ventilation</h2>



<p>Blocked, cracked, or disconnected vents and chimneys can prevent carbon monoxide from escaping your home properly. If you’ve recently had renovations, a new appliance installed, or extreme weather conditions, it’s a good idea to inspect venting systems. Our professionals can help ensure everything is connected and functioning properly for maximum safety.</p>



<h2>5. Be Cautious With Fireplaces and Wood Stoves</h2>



<p>Fireplaces and wood-burning stoves can also produce carbon monoxide. Ensure your chimney is clean and free of debris. Always open the damper before lighting a fire, and never leave a fire unattended. Regular cleaning and inspection by a professional chimney sweep is essential.</p>



<h2>6. Improve Indoor Air Quality in Edmonton Homes</h2>



<p>Carbon monoxide is just one aspect of indoor safety. Enhancing your home’s ventilation, humidity control, and air purification can significantly improve overall<a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/indoor-air-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/indoor-air-quality"> indoor air quality in Edmonton.</a> Better air quality means fewer health risks, better comfort, and greater energy efficiency throughout the year.</p>



<h2>7. Know the Symptoms of CO Poisoning</h2>



<p>Fatigue, headaches, dizziness, nausea, and confusion can all be symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure. If multiple people in your home experience these symptoms at the same time, especially in winter, leave the house immediately and call 911. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>



<h2>Your Safety Is Our Priority</h2>



<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we’re not just your local HVAC experts—we’re your neighbors. We believe that every family deserves a safe, healthy home. Whether you need a CO detector installed, your furnace inspected, or your air quality assessed, we’re here to help.</p>

<p>Selecting the right HVAC system for your commercial property is a critical decision that impacts energy efficiency, indoor comfort, and operational costs. A poorly chosen system can lead to inconsistent temperatures, high utility bills, and increased maintenance headaches. Whether you&#8217;re upgrading an outdated system or planning for new construction, choosing the appropriate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning setup requires careful consideration. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you make an informed choice.</p>



<span id="more-3042"></span>



<h2>Assess Your Space and Needs</h2>



<p>Before selecting any system, start by evaluating the size, layout, and function of your commercial space. A large office building will have very different HVAC needs than a small retail store or warehouse. Consider the number of employees, the equipment that generates heat, and how the space is used throughout the day. A professional load calculation can determine the precise heating and cooling requirements to avoid under- or over-sizing your system.</p>



<h2>Understand the Different Types of Commercial HVAC Systems</h2>



<p>There are several types of HVAC systems to consider:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Single Split Systems: </strong>Ideal for small offices, these systems are cost-effective and easy to install but require space for multiple outdoor units.</li><li><strong>Multi-Split Systems:</strong> Similar to single split systems but more efficient, they connect multiple indoor units to one outdoor unit, saving space and energy.</li><li><strong>VRF/VRV Systems: </strong>Best for medium to large commercial spaces, these systems offer superior energy efficiency and zoning capabilities.</li><li><strong>Packaged Systems: </strong>All components are housed in one unit, commonly installed on rooftops, making them great for buildings with limited indoor space.</li></ul>



<h2>Consider Energy Efficiency</h2>



<p>Energy efficiency is a key factor in reducing long-term operational costs. Look for systems with high SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) and EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) ratings. ENERGY STAR-certified equipment can provide significant savings over time. While energy-efficient units may cost more upfront, they usually pay off with lower utility bills and reduced maintenance needs.</p>



<h2>Plan for Zoning and Controls</h2>



<p>Modern commercial HVAC systems often come with zoning capabilities, allowing you to heat or cool specific areas independently. This not only improves comfort but also helps save energy by targeting only the zones that are in use. Programmable thermostats and smart HVAC controls can further optimize your system&#8217;s performance.</p>



<h2>Factor in Maintenance and Service</h2>



<p>No matter how efficient or advanced your system is, regular maintenance is essential to keep it running smoothly. When choosing a system, consider the availability of local service providers, warranty options, and the ease of accessing replacement parts. A well-maintained HVAC system will last longer and perform more reliably.</p>



<h2>Work with Local Experts</h2>



<p>Choosing the right HVAC system is not a one-size-fits-all process. Partnering with WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling, and Plumbing, who understand your local climate and building codes, ensures your system is tailored to meet both performance and regulatory standards. For example, businesses seeking <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/commercial-hvac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/commercial-hvac">commercial HVAC in Edmonton, AB, </a>need systems that can handle extreme cold and fluctuating temperatures efficiently.</p>

<p>The most common source of leaks is a loose or faulty connection. Check the cold water inlet and hot water outlet pipes to make sure they are securely attached. Over time, fittings can corrode or loosen due to expansion and contraction, especially in older systems.</p>



<h3>Temperature &amp; Pressure Relief Valve (T&amp;P Valve)</h3>



<p>This valve is designed to release water if the tank’s pressure gets too high. If the valve is faulty or there’s excessive pressure, it may start leaking. Make sure the valve is not stuck open or clogged with sediment.</p>



<h3>Drain Valve Leaks</h3>



<p>Located near the bottom of the tank, the drain valve is used during maintenance to flush out sediment. If this valve is not tightly closed or has degraded over time, it can leak. A slow drip from the spout may mean it needs tightening or replacement.</p>



<h3>Internal Tank Corrosion</h3>



<p>If you notice water leaking from the bottom of the heater, internal corrosion could be the culprit. Over time, sediment builds up inside the tank and can corrode the lining, causing leaks. Unfortunately, once the tank is compromised, replacement is usually necessary.</p>



<h3>Condensation</h3>



<p>Sometimes, what looks like a leak is condensation, especially in colder climates like Edmonton. If your water heater is in a cool area and is working hard, moisture may form on the outside. This isn&#8217;t a sign of damage, but it can still create puddles and lead to confusion.</p>



<h2>What You Should Do Now</h2>



<h3>Turn Off the Power Supply</h3>



<p>For electric water heaters, shut off the power at the circuit breaker. If you have a gas model, switch the gas control valve to the &#8220;off&#8221; position.</p>



<h3>Shut Off the Water Supply</h3>



<p>Find the cold water shutoff valve (usually located at the top of the heater) and turn it off to prevent more water from entering the tank.</p>



<h3>Inspect the Source</h3>



<p>Use a flashlight to examine the unit. Check around valves, fittings, and the base of the tank. This will help you or your plumber quickly identify the issue.</p>



<h3>Call a Professional</h3>



<p>Unless the leak is due to something simple like condensation or a loose fitting, most water heater repairs are best left to professionals. Especially if the tank is damaged or old, trying to fix it yourself could make things worse. They have the tools and experience to fix the issue safely and prevent further damage.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/th-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/th-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3026" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/th-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/th-1.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Running a business comes with countless responsibilities, and one area that often goes unnoticed until a problem arises is the plumbing system. Whether you operate a restaurant, office, retail store, or warehouse, reliable plumbing is essential for day-to-day operations. Ignoring small issues can quickly lead to costly repairs, safety concerns, and downtime that impacts your bottom line. Here are some of the most common commercial plumbing problems business owners should watch for—and how to prevent them.</p>



<span id="more-3019"></span>



<h2>1. Clogged Drains and Toilets</h2>



<p>Clogged drains and toilets are among the most frequent plumbing issues in commercial buildings. High foot traffic means restrooms and sinks are used more often, increasing the likelihood of blockages caused by debris, paper products, or grease. Regular drain cleaning and clear signage can help prevent misuse and maintain flow.</p>



<h2>2. Leaky Faucets and Pipes</h2>



<p>A small leak may not seem like a big deal, but over time, it can waste thousands of gallons of water and inflate your utility bills. Leaky pipes can also damage walls, ceilings, and flooring. Regular inspections and prompt repairs are essential to reduce water waste and prevent structural damage.</p>



<h2>3. Water Temperature Inconsistencies</h2>



<p>In commercial settings like restaurants, gyms, or salons, consistent hot water is crucial. Malfunctioning water heaters, outdated systems, or mineral buildup can lead to temperature fluctuations. Installing a high-capacity commercial water heater and scheduling routine maintenance can ensure reliable performance.</p>



<h2>4. Sewer Line Backups</h2>



<p>Sewer line problems can cause serious disruptions, especially if they result in unpleasant odors or health hazards. Tree root intrusion, aging pipes, or buildup from improper disposal can all lead to blockages. Video inspections and hydro-jetting are effective ways to diagnose and resolve sewer line issues before they escalate.</p>



<h2>5. Low Water Pressure</h2>



<p>Low water pressure can be frustrating for employees and customers alike. It may signal a hidden leak, pipe corrosion, or issues with the municipal water supply. A licensed plumber can assess the cause and recommend solutions to restore proper flow throughout your building.</p>



<h2>6. Outdated Fixtures and Pipes</h2>



<p>Older buildings often have aging plumbing systems that aren’t up to modern standards. Outdated fixtures may not comply with current building codes or efficiency standards, leading to higher costs and potential violations. Upgrading to energy-efficient fixtures and replacing old pipes can improve performance and reduce long-term expenses.</p>



<h2>7. Emergency Plumbing Situations</h2>



<p>Emergencies like burst pipes or overflowing toilets can happen at any time. Having a trusted plumbing partner who offers 24/7 service is key to minimizing damage and getting back to business quickly.<br><br>When it comes to <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/commercial-plumbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/commercial-plumbing">commercial plumbing in Edmonton, AB</a>, it’s important to work with professionals who understand the unique needs of commercial properties.

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-27.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-27.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3017" width="185" height="185" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-27.jpg 220w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-27-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 185px) 100vw, 185px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>When it comes to upgrading your home’s water heating system, energy efficiency, cost savings, and convenience are likely top priorities. That’s why more homeowners are considering tankless water heaters as a modern solution. But is a tankless water heater right for your home? Let’s explore the pros, cons, and key considerations to help you decide.</p>



<span id="more-3007"></span>



<h2>What Is a Tankless Water Heater?</h2>



<p>Unlike traditional models that store hot water in a tank, tankless water heaters heat water on demand. That means you get hot water instantly—without waiting for a tank to fill up or reheat. These systems are compact, typically wall-mounted, and ideal for homeowners looking to save space and reduce energy bills.</p>



<h2>Benefits of Tankless Water Heaters</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Energy Efficiency: </strong>Tankless systems only heat water when needed, which can significantly reduce your energy consumption—especially in smaller households.</li><li><strong>Endless Hot Water: </strong>With a properly sized system, you’ll never run out of hot water during showers or while doing laundry and dishes at the same time.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Savings:</strong> Though the upfront cost may be higher, many homeowners see savings over time through lower utility bills and fewer repairs.</li><li><strong>Space-Saving Design: </strong>Without the need for a bulky tank, these systems are great for homes with limited utility space.</li><li><strong>Longer Lifespan:</strong> Tankless units often last up to 20 years, compared to 10–15 years for conventional heaters.</li></ul>



<h2>Things to Consider Before Switching</h2>



<p>While tankless water heaters offer many advantages, they’re not the perfect fit for every household.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Upfront Costs: </strong>Installation can be more expensive due to the need for upgraded gas lines or electrical work.</li><li><strong>Flow Rate Limits:</strong> If multiple taps or appliances are using hot water simultaneously, a single unit may struggle to keep up. You might need more than one system for larger homes.</li><li><strong>Maintenance Requirements:</strong> Hard water can cause buildup in tankless systems, so regular descaling may be necessary—especially in areas with mineral-rich water.</li></ul>



<h2>Is It Right for You?</h2>



<p>The best way to determine if a tankless water heater is right for your home is to consider your household size, water usage habits, and budget. If your family uses a moderate amount of hot water and you’re looking to reduce your carbon footprint, this could be an excellent upgrade. Homeowners exploring <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters">tankless water heaters in Edmonton, AB</a> should also think about local climate and water quality, both of which can influence system performance and maintenance needs.<br><br>At the end of the day, investing in a tankless water heater is not just about instant hot water—it’s about long-term comfort, efficiency, and value. Whether you’re building a new home or upgrading your current system, getting professional advice is crucial.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="198" src="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13-300x198.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3003" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Plumbing problems can range from minor annoyances to full-blown emergencies. But how do you know when it’s time to call in a professional—immediately? Some issues can wait, while others require urgent attention to prevent serious damage to your home. Here’s how to tell the difference. If you’re facing a plumbing disaster, don’t wait. Quick action can save you from costly damage and stress. For<a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/emergency-plumbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emergency plumbing in Edmonton, AB</a>, trust the experts to handle the situation fast and efficiently.</p>



<span id="more-2992"></span>



<h2>Burst Pipes &#8211; Act Fast!</h2>



<p>If a pipe bursts in your home, don’t hesitate—turn off your water supply and call a plumber right away. Burst pipes can quickly flood your home, causing thousands of dollars in damage. This is especially common in winter when freezing temperatures cause pipes to expand and crack. The longer you wait, the worse the situation gets, so immediate action is key.</p>



<h2>Sewage Backups &#8211; A Mess You Don&#8217;t Want to Handle</h2>



<p>Few things are worse than sewage backing up into your sinks, tubs, or toilets. Not only is it disgusting, but it also poses serious health risks. If you notice foul smells, slow drains, or water pooling around your floor drains, don’t ignore it. A sewage backup is a sign of a major blockage in your main sewer line, and it won’t clear up on its own. Call an emergency plumber to prevent further contamination and damage.</p>



<h2>No Water in Your Home</h2>



<p>If you turn on your faucets and nothing comes out, you’ve got a serious problem. A sudden loss of water can be caused by a major pipe leak, frozen pipes, or an issue with your main water line. Before calling a plumber, check with your neighbors to see if it’s a municipal issue. If not, you’ll need professional help to diagnose and fix the problem.</p>



<h2>Overflowing Toilets That Won&#8217;t Stop</h2>



<p>A single clogged toilet isn’t an emergency—unless plunging doesn’t work, and water keeps rising with every flush. An overflowing toilet can quickly turn into a disaster, damaging flooring and spreading bacteria. If shutting off the water valve behind the toilet doesn’t stop the flow, it’s time to call for help.</p>



<h2>Water Heater Leaks or No Hot Water</h2>



<p>A lack of hot water is more than just an inconvenience—it can indicate a failing water heater. If your water heater is leaking or making strange noises, it could be on the verge of a breakdown. Leaks from the tank can cause water damage and even lead to mold growth if not addressed quickly.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Not an Emergency?</h2>



<p>Some plumbing issues, while frustrating, don’t require an immediate call. Dripping faucets, slow drains, or minor leaks can usually wait for a scheduled appointment. However, if a minor issue is getting worse, don’t ignore it—small leaks can turn into bigger problems over time.<br><br><strong><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<p>So, you’ve decided to get a new furnace—great choice! Whether your old system finally gave out or you’re upgrading to something more energy-efficient, knowing what to expect during a furnace installation can help make the process smooth and stress-free.</p>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step look at what happens when you install a new furnace in your home.</p>



<span id="more-2983"></span>



<h2>1. Pre-Installation Prep</h2>



<p>Before installation, a professional HVAC technician will typically visit your home for an assessment. This ensures that the new furnace is the right size for your space and meets your heating needs. The technician will also check your existing ductwork, ventilation, and electrical connections to make sure everything is in good shape.<br><br>It’s a good idea to clear the area around your furnace so the crew has plenty of space to work. If you have pets or kids, plan to keep them away from the work area for safety.</p>



<h2>2. Removing the Old Furnace</h2>



<p>On installation day, the first step is removing the old unit. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Shutting off the power and gas supply</li><li>Disconnecting the old furnace from the ductwork and vents</li><li>Safely removing and disposing of the old system</li></ul>



<p>This part of the process can take a few hours, depending on how accessible your furnace is and whether any additional modifications are needed.</p>



<h2>3. Installing the New Furnace</h2>



<p>Once the old system is out, the new furnace is carefully positioned and connected to your ductwork, gas line, and electrical system. The technician will ensure:</p>



<ul><li>Proper alignment with existing ductwork</li><li>Secure gas and electrical connections</li><li>Correct airflow and ventilation</li></ul>



<p>A <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces">furnace installation in Edmonton, AB</a> requires compliance with local building codes, so your technician will make sure everything meets safety and efficiency standards.</p>



<h2>4. System Testing &amp; Fine-Tuning</h2>



<p>Before wrapping up, the HVAC team will test the system to ensure everything is working correctly. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Checking for gas leaks</li><li>Testing airflow and temperature output</li><li>Verifying that the thermostat is properly connected and calibrated</li></ul>



<p>They’ll also walk you through how to use your new system, including any maintenance tips to keep it running efficiently.</p>



<h2>5. Post-Installation Cleanup &amp; Final Walkthrough</h2>



<p>A professional team won’t leave a mess behind. Expect them to clean up their work area and remove any debris from the installation. Before they go, they’ll answer any last-minute questions and make sure you’re comfortable with your new furnace.</p>



<h2>Enjoy Your Warm &amp; Cozy Home!</h2>



<p>A properly installed furnace can make all the difference in keeping your home warm and your energy bills in check. Be sure to schedule regular maintenance to keep it running efficiently for years to come.</p>

<p>Valentine’s Day is all about love—so why not show your home some love, too? Your HVAC system works hard all year to keep you comfortable and now might be the perfect time to give it the upgrade it deserves. A <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/heating-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/heating-installation">heating upgrade in Edmonton</a> isn’t just about warmth; it’s an investment in efficiency, reliability, and long-term savings. Let’s explore different heating systems and why upgrading now can be a smart (and heartfelt) decision.</p>



<span id="more-2972"></span>



<h2>Furnaces: The Classic Choice for Cozy Nights</h2>



<p>A high-efficiency furnace can make a huge difference in your home’s comfort and energy bills. If your current furnace is over 15 years old, it may be working harder than it should. New models boast advanced features like variable-speed blowers and smart thermostat compatibility, giving you better control over your indoor climate. Plus, with modern energy-efficient models, you can reduce heating costs while keeping your home toasty all winter.</p>



<h2>Heat Pumps: A Year-Round Love Story</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a system that does it all, consider a heat pump. These units provide both heating and cooling, making them a great choice for homeowners who want energy efficiency year-round. Heat pumps work by transferring heat rather than generating it, making them an eco-friendly option with lower operating costs. Whether you’re heating up for winter or cooling down for summer, a heat pump keeps your home comfortable without breaking the bank.</p>



<h2>Boilers: The Quiet and Reliable Partner</h2>



<p>Boilers might not get as much attention as furnaces, but they provide consistent and even heat without the need for ducts. If you love the idea of radiant floor heating or prefer a system that doesn’t blow air around, a boiler upgrade could be the perfect match for your home. Newer models are highly efficient, and with proper maintenance, they can last for decades.</p>



<h2>Ductless Mini-Splits: The Flexible Option</h2>



<p>If your home has areas that never seem to warm up properly, a ductless mini-split system could be the answer. These systems allow you to heat specific zones without relying on ductwork, giving you complete control over different rooms. They’re also incredibly efficient, making them an excellent choice for supplementing your current heating system or providing an alternative for homes without traditional ductwork.</p>



<h2>Why Upgrade Now?</h2>



<p>February might not seem like the obvious time for an HVAC upgrade, but it makes perfect sense. Winter weather reminds us just how important a reliable heating system is, and HVAC companies often have better availability outside of peak seasons. Plus, with energy rebates and financing options available, investing in a more efficient system now could mean major savings in the long run.</p>



<h2>Show Your Home Some Love</h2>



<p>Upgrading your heating system isn’t just about staying warm—it’s about improving your home’s efficiency, lowering energy bills, and ensuring your family’s comfort for years to come. So, if you’re ready to make the switch, now’s the time to explore your options.</p>
