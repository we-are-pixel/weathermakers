<p>What is an AC installer, and are they different from an AC technician? Well, the major difference is in specialization. <strong>An AC installer is someone who specializes in installing and setting up your new air conditioning technology. </strong>Technicians, on the other hand, are specialists in diagnosing and repairing a problem in your air conditioner.</p>



<p>So, some of the strategies you might employ when searching for an HVAC technician won&#8217;t necessarily work the same when trying to find an installer. The jobs are different and the specific professionals that do the work might be different.</p>



<p>How can you specifically prepare for AC installation, and how can you choose the best <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air conditioning installer in Edmonton, AB?</a> Keep reading to learn more.</p>

<h2>System Specialization</h2>



<p>First, you want to hire a team that&#8217;s got system specialization up their sleeve because you might not know the kind of AC you want to install yet. There are many different kinds of air conditioners, from central AC units to ductless heat pumps and centralized heat pumps. Each of these requires a very precise kind of installation that only a licensed and knowledgeable AC installer knows how to do.</p>



<p>But some companies don&#8217;t have this kind of specialized approach. You might be in a bit of trouble if you decide to purchase a heat pump for better efficiency and heating properties, only to hire an installer who has experience solely with central AC units. This is a bad situation and one you&#8217;ll want to avoid.</p>



<p><strong>Make sure you check with your HVAC installer to see what systems they&#8217;ve installed before and if they&#8217;re comfortable with the setup of your unique system.</strong></p>



<h2>Knowledge of Unique Setups</h2>



<p>Every home is different. Some homes are old and set up specifically for one kind of unit. Other modern homes are designed better for ductless AC units. This can heavily impact the installation process to the point of making it take much longer if the installer isn&#8217;t prepared for your unique situation.</p>



<p>Choose an AC installer who has experience with unique home setups. Tell them the first moment you can about how your home might be different from the average home, and where you might need some expertise. A trained and experienced AC installer will be able to figure this stuff out for you, as long as you&#8217;re upfront with them about your home situation.</p>



<h2>Load Calculation</h2>



<p>This is a big part of AC installation and something you just can&#8217;t afford to have done incorrectly. <strong>Load calculation </strong>includes the precise measurement of your home&#8217;s air volume for the specific AC unit you get installed.</p>



<p>Think about it, your air conditioner can come in different sizes, and it needs to be sized specifically for the air volume in your home. This can only be done when we measure the cubic footage of your indoor space, which can depend on a lot of things from tall ceilings to long hallways.</p>



<p>Luckily, this comes with training and our team can get this done by the book every time.</p>



<p>There are other important metrics for an AC installer to consider, but everything else comes with choosing the right team. Skip all of these steps by just working with our team of qualified AC installers for your next big purchase.</p>
