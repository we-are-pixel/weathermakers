<p>Air conditioners, when working correctly can often just make a clicking sound and a whir as they send air gently through the vents of your home. Rarely do they make sounds beyond that, and when they do, it’s usually a sign that something is wrong.</p>

<h2>Problematic Sounds</h2>



<p>Not every sound signifies a problem. Noises like the whooshing of air from the vents and the quick click of the system turning on when the thermostat signals too it, are all signs that the system is working as intended. But the following noises are never good to hear, not even if they’re happening on a mildly warm day compared to a heatwave.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hissing and bubbling. </strong>An air conditioner that starts hissing or bubbling is likely leaking refrigerant. This chemical is the lifeblood of your air conditioner and it’s required for the system to work effectively. Without refrigerant, your air conditioner basically becomes an oversized fan.</li><li><strong>Grinding. </strong>An air conditioner that’s grinding is likely having issues with the compressor. This component consumes the most electricity and is responsible for pressurizing the refrigerant. This is never a good sign and requires repairs immediately.</li><li><strong>Clanking or rattling. </strong>Clanking or rattling can often correspond to a component that is loose or a screw that’s come apart. This might not sound like a bad issue, but that loose component can bump into one that’s sensitive and expensive, leading to further issues down the line.</li><li><strong>Constant clicking. </strong>A click for the system to start up or turn off is normal. But multiple clicks can insinuate that your air conditioner has an issue with the capacitors.</li><li><strong>Buzzing. </strong>Like the last problem, buzzing can also indicate a problem with your air conditioner’s electrical components. Frayed wires, burnt out components, and even an issue with the thermostat can lead to buzzing.</li><li><strong>Squealing. </strong>A loose fan motor belt can easily cause the system to start squealing. Don’t neglect this issue just because it’s coming from the fan of your system, it still needs to be fixed before it breaks.</li></ul>



<p>Remember, only a licensed professional has what it takes to address these issues head-on.</p>
