<p>Your heat pump has three main responsibilities–to cool your home, heat your home, and to use energy efficiently. If it messes up one of those three responsibilities, then it might be time to replace or fix the system. After all, why have a heat pump if it’s not going to keep your home comfy or be affordable to run?</p>



<p>This is where today’s topic becomes immensely important. <strong>Heat pump problems can impact efficiency, and they actually do a lot more harm to the efficient operation of your system than you might think.</strong></p>



<p>Want to know how? Or perhaps you’re not quite convinced of this fact yet? Regardless, follow through this blog for some information on how efficiency is impacted by a problem, and for other methods that can keep your system running at peak efficiency. Just make sure you schedule any work for your <a href="/service-areas/katy-tx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heat pump in Edmonton, AB </a>with us!</p>

<h2>Detecting a Problem</h2>



<p>First, before we can talk about how problems impact efficiency, we need to determine whether your heat pump is having problems of its own or not. This can be tricky to do online.</p>



<p><strong>For an accurate diagnosis that doesn’t rely on subjective material, schedule an appointment with our team. </strong>We train to specifically diagnose HVAC issues, so you don’t have to worry about whether your system is running well or if it’s encountering problems.</p>



<p>But for anyone else, here are a few signs your heat pump is in need of repair.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Strange or loud noises</strong></li><li><strong>Foul odors like a dirty sock smell or a sweet scent</strong></li><li><strong>Constant shut-offs and tripping circuits</strong></li><li><strong>It’s not meeting the demand on your thermostat</strong></li><li><strong>There’s no airflow coming from the vents</strong></li></ul>



<p>If these points sound at all familiar, then you’ve got a problem that needs repair. Now let’s get to why this might be more important to schedule than you think.</p>



<h2>How Issues Impact Efficiency</h2>



<p>A heat pump problem is usually caused by a component that’s either failing or broken. For instance, a <strong>rattling </strong>sound can be caused by a loose screw or a component that’s broken free and is bouncing around the housing of the unit.</p>



<p>While this might sound like a small problem that can wait, the issue comes from this component bouncing <em>into</em> one of the other more sensitive components of your system. This can not only hamper the system’s effectiveness but ruin the efficiency of your heat pump.</p>



<p>For example, if this component bumps into the coils of your system, it might hamper the system’s ability to draw in heat and make it run for longer cycles, adding a substantial amount of money to your monthly cooling bills. And that’s just one type of problem!</p>



<h2>Maintenance and Repairs Are Key</h2>



<p>First, if you’re experiencing any of the above-mentioned problems, make sure you schedule repairs to get it fixed. In the meantime, if your heat pump seems to be running just fine, you’ll also want to schedule routine maintenance on a yearly basis. We can clean and inspect the unit to ensure it works as efficiently as possible. Don’t pay more than you have to for cooling or heating in Edmonton, AB!</p>
