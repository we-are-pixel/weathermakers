<p>There&#8217;s a misconception going around that your heating system is the only thing that can help keep your home comfortable when temperatures suddenly drop. While this might sound like it&#8217;s true, there&#8217;s another system out there that can do an impressive job of keeping your home comfortable, healthy, and happy.</p>



<p>With such an unpredictable spring, we&#8217;re still expecting some frigid days ahead, so you&#8217;ll want to make sure your heating system is doing the best job it can. And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;d like to talk about how you can make a difference by coupling your furnace with a <a href="/indoor-air-quality/humidifiers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humidifier in Edmonton, AB.</a></p>



<p>That&#8217;s right! Humidifiers aren&#8217;t just for sleeping better and staying safe when an illness is going around. They&#8217;re actually incredibly good at easing the burden on your heating unit and allowing your home to stay more comfortable for longer. Let&#8217;s get into it down below.</p>



<span id="more-2846"></span>



<h2>What&#8217;s the Problem?</h2>



<p>When winter arrives, it carries with it <strong>cold </strong>and <strong>dry </strong>air. This is in stark contrast to the <strong>hot</strong> and <strong>humid</strong> air we get during the summer. Cold air is so dry that it can sometimes cause your skin to crack, your nose to dry up, and even give you issues with constant static shocks.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s a solution in the midst of all these problems. We&#8217;re talking about the humidifier!</p>



<p>A humidifier is a simple system. It takes a tank of water and turns it into water vapor, adding humidity in your air. This humidity keeps your body healthy and your home feeling more comfortable. But it has a hidden benefit as well, which isn&#8217;t mentioned very often.</p>



<h2>A Powerful Combination</h2>



<p>When a whole house humidifier is paired with a heating system like a furnace, you can get excellent temperature control. This is because <strong>humidity actually helps to hold heat in your air, </strong>allowing you to feel comfortable even when the temperature is the same as it would be without a humidifier.</p>



<p>Air that&#8217;s more humid is warmer for longer and gives your home a cozier feeling than air that&#8217;s dry. This is a major reason why we recommend customers invest in a humidifier.</p>



<p>Think about it this way&#8211;a humidifier will ease the burden on your furnace because it won&#8217;t have to run as many cycles in a day due to the humidity holding heat for longer. The efficiency difference might not be huge, but it&#8217;s noticeable on your bills.</p>



<h2>Additional Benefits of a Humidifier</h2>



<p>Humidifiers also come with a wide array of benefits, like <strong>better skin, better protection against illnesses, and more comfort. </strong>Humidity can also keep your antique furniture and old family heirlooms from cracking and breaking due to the dry, unforgiving air.</p>



<p>Humidifiers are some of the most popular systems that people purchase in our area, and they help make life comfortable in such a cold climate!</p>



<h2>Schedule an Installation Today</h2>



<p>Ready to have your home protected with a powerful layer of humidity? Then schedule a consultation with our team so we can measure the air in your home and set you up with a whole house humidifier that does the trick.</p>

<span id="more-2704"></span>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heat pumps have gained popularity in recent years due to several reasons:</strong></h3>



<ol><li><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Heat pumps are highly energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. They can extract heat from the outdoor air and transfer it to indoor spaces for heating purposes. Compared to traditional heating systems like furnaces or electric resistance heaters, heat pumps can provide heat in the shoulder seasons with significantly less energy consumption. This efficiency translates to lower energy bills and reduced environmental impact.</li><li><strong>Renewable energy integration:</strong> Heat pumps can be combined with renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines. By using electricity generated from renewable sources, heat pumps can provide heating and cooling while minimizing reliance on fossil fuels. This aligns with the growing emphasis on sustainability and reducing carbon emissions.</li><li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Heat pumps offer both heating and cooling capabilities. They can be used for space heating during cooler months and reverse the cycle to provide cooling during warmer months. This dual functionality reduces the time four gas furnace runs during the heating season, saving you money and protecting the environment.</li><li><strong>Government incentives and policies:</strong> Many governments around the world have implemented incentives and policies to promote the adoption of heat pumps. These can include tax credits, rebates, grants, or favorable financing options. Such initiatives aim to encourage the use of energy-efficient technologies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li><li><strong>Technological advancements:</strong> Advancements in heat pump technology have improved their efficiency, performance, and reliability. Innovations like variable-speed compressors, smart controls, and improved refrigerants have contributed to better energy savings and enhanced user experience. As these technologies continue to evolve, heat pumps become more attractive to consumers.</li><li><strong>Increasing environmental awareness:</strong> There is a growing global awareness about climate change and the need to transition to more sustainable practices. Heat pumps, with their ability to reduce carbon footprint and dependence on fossil fuels, align with this environmental consciousness. As a result, more individuals and organizations are opting for heat pump systems as part of their efforts to contribute to a greener future.</li></ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, versatility, government incentives, technological advancements, and environmental considerations has propelled the popularity of heat pumps in recent years.  If you are looking for heating and cooling options for your home reach out to us. </h3>
