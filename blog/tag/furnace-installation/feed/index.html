<p>So, you’ve decided to get a new furnace—great choice! Whether your old system finally gave out or you’re upgrading to something more energy-efficient, knowing what to expect during a furnace installation can help make the process smooth and stress-free.</p>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step look at what happens when you install a new furnace in your home.</p>



<span id="more-2983"></span>



<h2>1. Pre-Installation Prep</h2>



<p>Before installation, a professional HVAC technician will typically visit your home for an assessment. This ensures that the new furnace is the right size for your space and meets your heating needs. The technician will also check your existing ductwork, ventilation, and electrical connections to make sure everything is in good shape.<br><br>It’s a good idea to clear the area around your furnace so the crew has plenty of space to work. If you have pets or kids, plan to keep them away from the work area for safety.</p>



<h2>2. Removing the Old Furnace</h2>



<p>On installation day, the first step is removing the old unit. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Shutting off the power and gas supply</li><li>Disconnecting the old furnace from the ductwork and vents</li><li>Safely removing and disposing of the old system</li></ul>



<p>This part of the process can take a few hours, depending on how accessible your furnace is and whether any additional modifications are needed.</p>



<h2>3. Installing the New Furnace</h2>



<p>Once the old system is out, the new furnace is carefully positioned and connected to your ductwork, gas line, and electrical system. The technician will ensure:</p>



<ul><li>Proper alignment with existing ductwork</li><li>Secure gas and electrical connections</li><li>Correct airflow and ventilation</li></ul>



<p>A <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces">furnace installation in Edmonton, AB</a> requires compliance with local building codes, so your technician will make sure everything meets safety and efficiency standards.</p>



<h2>4. System Testing &amp; Fine-Tuning</h2>



<p>Before wrapping up, the HVAC team will test the system to ensure everything is working correctly. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Checking for gas leaks</li><li>Testing airflow and temperature output</li><li>Verifying that the thermostat is properly connected and calibrated</li></ul>



<p>They’ll also walk you through how to use your new system, including any maintenance tips to keep it running efficiently.</p>



<h2>5. Post-Installation Cleanup &amp; Final Walkthrough</h2>



<p>A professional team won’t leave a mess behind. Expect them to clean up their work area and remove any debris from the installation. Before they go, they’ll answer any last-minute questions and make sure you’re comfortable with your new furnace.</p>



<h2>Enjoy Your Warm &amp; Cozy Home!</h2>



<p>A properly installed furnace can make all the difference in keeping your home warm and your energy bills in check. Be sure to schedule regular maintenance to keep it running efficiently for years to come.</p>
