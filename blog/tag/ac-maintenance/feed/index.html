<p>Maintenance is usually a topic we reserve for springtime when temperatures are mild and our schedules are wide open. Now, we’re dealing with heatwave after heatwave and customers calling our hotline on a daily basis. But we think it’s important that we relay one important fact to our customers–<strong>it’s never too late for maintenance.</strong></p>



<p>It’s true! Whether your central air conditioner missed one maintenance appointment or has never been maintained before, we promise that this service can be important right now. Sure, it might be a bit trickier to pencil you into our busy schedule, but we can make it work.</p>



<p>Keep reading to learn why <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AC maintenance in Edmonton, AB</a> is valuable even during the hottest months of the summer.</p>



<span id="more-2884"></span>



<h2>Maintenance Requires Consistency</h2>



<p>We want to level with you for a moment. Air conditioning maintenance is important, but it’s not something that’s incredibly time-sensitive. Compared to AC repairs, which need to be done very quickly to address a budding problem inside of your system, air conditioning maintenance is something that requires consistency.</p>



<p>When you hear the word <strong>consistency</strong>, what do you think of? Do you think of going to the gym or getting your car’s oil changed? These are things that need to be done on a regular basis, but it doesn’t really matter what season you do them. AC maintenance fits in that category. It’s vital for your AC’s health and your home comfort, but it can be done in spring, summer, fall, and even winter!</p>



<h2>It Doesn’t Matter the Season</h2>



<p>Notice how we said AC maintenance can be done in winter? It’s true! It’s never too late to invest in AC maintenance.</p>



<p>So, if you’ve skipped out on maintenance this year, we’d urge you to set up an appointment with our team of professionals ASAP. Even if it’s in a month when the heatwaves die down, at least you’ll have a visit on the books so you can rest easy.</p>



<h2>Avoid Repairs and Get Peace of Mind</h2>



<p>One of the best reasons to invest in maintenance is to avoid repairs. If you’re concerned about your air conditioner to the point where it’s stressing you out, then maintenance is going to be your best friend.</p>



<p>This isn’t a strange occurrence, it happens all the time. In particularly hot summers with routine heatwaves, customers can truly understand how much their AC systems keep them comfortable and sane on a regular basis. If something were to happen to this constant stream of cooling, your life might be dramatically halted. AC maintenance helps to stop repairs from popping up unexpectedly, giving an AC technician access to your system to make sure it’s in good shape.</p>



<p>There’s another benefit you get from this kind of routine service–<strong>peace of mind</strong>. Sleep easier, be more relaxed, and relieve stress by knowing that your AC is in good hands, even when it doesn’t need to be repaired.</p>

<p>Before you scroll away from this blog, we&#8217;re not referring to air filtration systems or air purifiers in the title. Nope, we&#8217;re talking to any homeowner who has a central air conditioner, heat pump, or even a ductless mini split. Every single one of these systems has an air filter that needs to be cleaned on a regular basis.</p>



<p>And the best part is? <strong>We don&#8217;t need to be the ones to clean it. You can clean your air filter whenever you want.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, this isn&#8217;t a typical blog about hiring a professional for <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AC maintenance in Edmonton, AB</a> or scheduling a diagnosis with an expert. This is a bit of maintenance that you can do right now, and we&#8217;d argue, homeowners should be doing it on a very regular basis to avoid problems down the line.</p>



<p>Want to learn more about this component? Keep reading and we&#8217;ll get to the bottom of it.</p>



<span id="more-2865"></span>



<h2>What the Air Filter Does</h2>



<p>The air filter is an interesting component in your air conditioner. Technically, it&#8217;s in your air ducts and not your AC unit, but it still counts as one of its most important components.</p>



<p>The air filter blocks our harmful contaminants like dust, debris, and pet dander. These contaminants are harmless to us (albeit uncomfortable to live with), but they can be extremely detrimental to your air conditioner and the cooling process.</p>



<p>The air filter keeps them from gunking up the coils and causing issues over time.</p>



<h2>The Problems With a Clogged Filter</h2>



<p>What kinds of issues can a clogged air filter cause? Here are a few:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Poor efficiency and increased energy consumption.</strong></li><li><strong>Uncomfortable temperatures and a reduction in the AC&#8217;s effectiveness.</strong></li><li><strong>Poor air quality.</strong></li><li><strong>Wear and tear.</strong></li></ul>



<p>All of these problems can come with an increased likelihood of a system breakdown and other issues that require professional repair.</p>



<h2>Changing the Filter: A Guide</h2>



<p>We could get really detailed with this kind of guide, but you&#8217;ll likely find that stuff in video form throughout the rest of the internet. We&#8217;d like to keep it short and simple while also reminding you that <strong>our team can walk you through this process when you schedule maintenance.</strong></p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s get right to it. How do you change your air filter?</p>



<ol><li>Locate the <strong>return air duct</strong> which funnels air into your air conditioner. This system should be marked with an arrow, or at least labeled correctly so you can find it.</li><li>There should be a flap which, when lifted, allows you to remove the air filter that is currently placed within the system.</li><li>Make sure you <strong>turn your air conditioner off before you remove the filter.</strong></li><li>Go ahead and remove the filter.</li><li>If the filter is reusable (i.e. plastic or some kind of durable material), then you can clean it off with a damp paper towel. Make sure it dries afterward.</li><li>If the filter is disposable, you can just throw it out and replace it with a new one.</li><li>When this is complete, just place the new filter back into the slot where the old one was. Try to make sure it&#8217;s facing the correct direction when doing so.</li></ol>



<p>At this point, turn your air conditioner back on and enjoy the comfort!</p>

<p>If we were to ask you what you thought about maintenance, what would you say? Here are a few familiar responses we&#8217;ve seen:</p>



<p><em>I can just do my own maintenance. I don&#8217;t need to belong to a club.</em></p>



<p><em>Isn&#8217;t maintenance optional? It seems like an extra thing that we just don&#8217;t need.</em></p>



<p><em>Maintenance is only for certain HVAC systems. My air conditioner doesn&#8217;t need it.</em></p>



<p>These are all common reasons for people to skip out on maintenance, and while we understand the various sentiments, the data proves something else. <a href="/maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AC maintenance in Edmonton, AB</a> is a vital service that is not as optional as people think, and we&#8217;d like to cover some of the best benefits that come from investing in such a service.</p>



<span id="more-2851"></span>



<h2>The Benefits of Being a Member</h2>



<p>Joining our Comfort Club comes with a lot of unique perks and advantages, but the most important thing it gets you is <strong>maintenance. </strong>Maintenance is a yearly service where one of our licensed technicians comes to your home and updates, inspects, and adjusts your system to make sure it&#8217;s working properly. Here are some of the major advantages you can hope to get</p>



<ul><li><strong>Improved efficiency over time.</strong> A well-maintained air conditioner is going to run with optimal efficiency. This means less energy is spent month after month and the system doesn&#8217;t cost too much over the length of its lifespan. On average, an air conditioner can expect to lose 5% of its efficiency cumulatively each year without maintenance, so this yearly appointment can be a big deal!</li><li><strong>System longevity.</strong> An air conditioner that has received maintenance over time is much more likely to last its full lifespan than a system that&#8217;s been neglected. You can hope to achieve a 10-15 year AC lifespan with maintenance, whereas an unmaintained system might need an early replacement.</li><li><strong>Inspections, tips, adjustments, and more.</strong> Maintenance itself can be a huge boon for your comfort. A technician adjusts your system, cleans it, and inspects it for any damage, giving you the green light for the next season. Feel free to ask us questions or tell us about your concerns during a maintenance visit.</li><li><strong>Retaining a system warranty.</strong> If your air conditioner is protected with a warranty, maintenance is usually a requirement in the fine print. No, maintenance can&#8217;t be done by anyone other than a licensed professional, and DIY maintenance risks voiding this warranty and damaging the interior components as well.</li></ul>



<h2>Benefits, Promotions, Advantages, and More</h2>



<p>Even if the maintenance visit itself wasn&#8217;t enticing enough, joining our club comes with a whole host of benefits like the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Emergency services and priority scheduling for club members</strong></li><li>20% discounts on repairs</li><li>Free thermostat battery replacement</li><li>Comfort Cash towards a new system replacement.</li><li>A powerful 1-year warranty on repairs.</li></ul>



<p>The truth is that for such a low cost, there are a ton of benefits you get with maintenance. It&#8217;s not just a small optional service like certain people might have you believe. It&#8217;s a powerful service that seeks to give you the most for your money.</p>
