<p>When the summer sun turns up the heat, your comfort at home becomes a top priority. If you&#8217;re exploring your cooling options and considering <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation">AC installation in Edmonton</a>, inverter air conditioners should be at the top of your list—and for good reason. At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we understand the importance of staying cool and energy-efficient all summer long. That’s why we recommend inverter ACs to our clients who want the best in performance, comfort, and savings.</p>



<span id="more-3067"></span>



<h2>What Makes Inverter ACs Different?</h2>



<p>Unlike traditional air conditioners that run on a simple on-off cycle, inverter ACs use advanced technology to adjust their compressor speed based on your cooling needs. This means they don&#8217;t have to power up and down constantly. Instead, they maintain a consistent temperature, giving you smoother, quieter, and more efficient performance. They also help maintain better humidity control, making your indoor environment feel fresher and less sticky even on the hottest days.<br><br>The result? A home that cools faster, stays cooler longer, and uses less energy, without the uncomfortable temperature swings that come with older AC systems.</p>



<h2>Energy Efficiency That Pays Off</h2>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of inverter ACs is their energy efficiency. Because they can regulate how much power they use depending on the situation, they consume significantly less electricity than non-inverter models. That means you’ll see a noticeable drop in your energy bills—even during those peak summer months when your AC is working hardest.<br><br>Plus, many inverter AC units are ENERGY STAR® certified, which not only helps reduce your carbon footprint but may also qualify you for local energy rebates.</p>



<h2>Quieter Operation, Better Sleep</h2>



<p>Have you ever been woken up in the middle of the night by your air conditioner clicking on? Inverter ACs operate at variable speeds, which significantly reduces noise. The smooth, steady airflow is ideal for bedrooms, nurseries, and other spaces where quiet is essential.</p>



<h2>Longer Lifespan, Fewer Repairs</h2>



<p>Inverter technology puts less strain on your system because it avoids the constant start-stop cycle of traditional ACs. This gentler operation helps extend the life of your unit and reduces wear and tear, meaning fewer service calls and lower maintenance costs over time. In the long run, this translates into real peace of mind, knowing your investment is built to last.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Edmonton’s Climate</h2>



<p>Edmonton summers can get hot, but they&#8217;re also unpredictable. Inverter ACs are great at adjusting quickly to changing temperatures, keeping your home comfortable no matter what the weather throws your way. When paired with professional AC installation in Edmonton, you’ll enjoy cooling that’s not just powerful, but smart.</p>



<h2>The Right Choice for Your Home</h2>



<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we believe your home deserves the best. That’s why we only install and recommend products we’d trust in our own homes. Inverter ACs offer unmatched benefits in terms of comfort, efficiency, and durability. If you&#8217;re thinking about upgrading your cooling system this summer, we’re here to help guide you through every step, from selection to expert installation.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="200" height="300" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2890" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>What is an AC installer, and are they different from an AC technician? Well, the major difference is in specialization. <strong>An AC installer is someone who specializes in installing and setting up your new air conditioning technology. </strong>Technicians, on the other hand, are specialists in diagnosing and repairing a problem in your air conditioner.</p>



<p>So, some of the strategies you might employ when searching for an HVAC technician won&#8217;t necessarily work the same when trying to find an installer. The jobs are different and the specific professionals that do the work might be different.</p>



<p>How can you specifically prepare for AC installation, and how can you choose the best <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air conditioning installer in Edmonton, AB?</a> Keep reading to learn more.</p>



<span id="more-2889"></span>



<h2>System Specialization</h2>



<p>First, you want to hire a team that&#8217;s got system specialization up their sleeve because you might not know the kind of AC you want to install yet. There are many different kinds of air conditioners, from central AC units to ductless heat pumps and centralized heat pumps. Each of these requires a very precise kind of installation that only a licensed and knowledgeable AC installer knows how to do.</p>



<p>But some companies don&#8217;t have this kind of specialized approach. You might be in a bit of trouble if you decide to purchase a heat pump for better efficiency and heating properties, only to hire an installer who has experience solely with central AC units. This is a bad situation and one you&#8217;ll want to avoid.</p>



<p><strong>Make sure you check with your HVAC installer to see what systems they&#8217;ve installed before and if they&#8217;re comfortable with the setup of your unique system.</strong></p>



<h2>Knowledge of Unique Setups</h2>



<p>Every home is different. Some homes are old and set up specifically for one kind of unit. Other modern homes are designed better for ductless AC units. This can heavily impact the installation process to the point of making it take much longer if the installer isn&#8217;t prepared for your unique situation.</p>



<p>Choose an AC installer who has experience with unique home setups. Tell them the first moment you can about how your home might be different from the average home, and where you might need some expertise. A trained and experienced AC installer will be able to figure this stuff out for you, as long as you&#8217;re upfront with them about your home situation.</p>



<h2>Load Calculation</h2>



<p>This is a big part of AC installation and something you just can&#8217;t afford to have done incorrectly. <strong>Load calculation </strong>includes the precise measurement of your home&#8217;s air volume for the specific AC unit you get installed.</p>



<p>Think about it, your air conditioner can come in different sizes, and it needs to be sized specifically for the air volume in your home. This can only be done when we measure the cubic footage of your indoor space, which can depend on a lot of things from tall ceilings to long hallways.</p>



<p>Luckily, this comes with training and our team can get this done by the book every time.</p>



<p>There are other important metrics for an AC installer to consider, but everything else comes with choosing the right team. Skip all of these steps by just working with our team of qualified AC installers for your next big purchase.</p>
