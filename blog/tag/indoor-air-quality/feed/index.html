<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we care deeply about your family’s comfort and safety, especially when it comes to silent dangers like carbon monoxide (CO). This colorless, odorless gas can quickly become life-threatening if undetected. Fortunately, with a few proactive steps, you can dramatically reduce the risk of exposure in your home. Here are simple, effective ways to protect your family and improve peace of mind.</p>



<span id="more-3053"></span>



<h2>1. Install Carbon Monoxide Detectors</h2>



<p>The first and most critical step is installing carbon monoxide detectors on every level of your home, particularly near sleeping areas. These life-saving devices alert you if CO levels become unsafe. Make sure to test them monthly and replace batteries every six months. If your detectors are more than seven years old, it’s time to replace them.</p>



<h2>2. Schedule Regular Furnace Maintenance</h2>



<p>Gas furnaces can cause a carbon monoxide leak if they’re not maintained properly. Annual inspections and tune-ups by qualified technicians ensure your system runs safely and efficiently. Our licensed team at WeatherMakers specializes in servicing all makes and models, helping you avoid unexpected leaks and costly repairs.</p>



<h2>3. Never Use Outdoor Appliances Indoors</h2>



<p>It might seem obvious, but using outdoor devices like BBQs, generators, or propane heaters inside your home or garage—even for a short time—can cause dangerous CO buildup. Always use these appliances outdoors and far away from doors, windows, and vents.</p>



<h2>4. Ensure Proper Ventilation</h2>



<p>Blocked, cracked, or disconnected vents and chimneys can prevent carbon monoxide from escaping your home properly. If you’ve recently had renovations, a new appliance installed, or extreme weather conditions, it’s a good idea to inspect venting systems. Our professionals can help ensure everything is connected and functioning properly for maximum safety.</p>



<h2>5. Be Cautious With Fireplaces and Wood Stoves</h2>



<p>Fireplaces and wood-burning stoves can also produce carbon monoxide. Ensure your chimney is clean and free of debris. Always open the damper before lighting a fire, and never leave a fire unattended. Regular cleaning and inspection by a professional chimney sweep is essential.</p>



<h2>6. Improve Indoor Air Quality in Edmonton Homes</h2>



<p>Carbon monoxide is just one aspect of indoor safety. Enhancing your home’s ventilation, humidity control, and air purification can significantly improve overall<a href="/indoor-air-quality.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/indoor-air-quality"> indoor air quality in Edmonton.</a> Better air quality means fewer health risks, better comfort, and greater energy efficiency throughout the year.</p>



<h2>7. Know the Symptoms of CO Poisoning</h2>



<p>Fatigue, headaches, dizziness, nausea, and confusion can all be symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure. If multiple people in your home experience these symptoms at the same time, especially in winter, leave the house immediately and call 911. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
