<p>Plumbing problems can range from minor annoyances to full-blown emergencies. But how do you know when it’s time to call in a professional—immediately? Some issues can wait, while others require urgent attention to prevent serious damage to your home. Here’s how to tell the difference. If you’re facing a plumbing disaster, don’t wait. Quick action can save you from costly damage and stress. For<a href="/plumbing/general-plumbing/emergency-plumbing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emergency plumbing in Edmonton, AB</a>, trust the experts to handle the situation fast and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Burst Pipes &#8211; Act Fast!</h2>



<p>If a pipe bursts in your home, don’t hesitate—turn off your water supply and call a plumber right away. Burst pipes can quickly flood your home, causing thousands of dollars in damage. This is especially common in winter when freezing temperatures cause pipes to expand and crack. The longer you wait, the worse the situation gets, so immediate action is key.</p>



<h2>Sewage Backups &#8211; A Mess You Don&#8217;t Want to Handle</h2>



<p>Few things are worse than sewage backing up into your sinks, tubs, or toilets. Not only is it disgusting, but it also poses serious health risks. If you notice foul smells, slow drains, or water pooling around your floor drains, don’t ignore it. A sewage backup is a sign of a major blockage in your main sewer line, and it won’t clear up on its own. Call an emergency plumber to prevent further contamination and damage.</p>



<h2>No Water in Your Home</h2>



<p>If you turn on your faucets and nothing comes out, you’ve got a serious problem. A sudden loss of water can be caused by a major pipe leak, frozen pipes, or an issue with your main water line. Before calling a plumber, check with your neighbors to see if it’s a municipal issue. If not, you’ll need professional help to diagnose and fix the problem.</p>



<h2>Overflowing Toilets That Won&#8217;t Stop</h2>



<p>A single clogged toilet isn’t an emergency—unless plunging doesn’t work, and water keeps rising with every flush. An overflowing toilet can quickly turn into a disaster, damaging flooring and spreading bacteria. If shutting off the water valve behind the toilet doesn’t stop the flow, it’s time to call for help.</p>



<h2>Water Heater Leaks or No Hot Water</h2>



<p>A lack of hot water is more than just an inconvenience—it can indicate a failing water heater. If your water heater is leaking or making strange noises, it could be on the verge of a breakdown. Leaks from the tank can cause water damage and even lead to mold growth if not addressed quickly.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Not an Emergency?</h2>



<p>Some plumbing issues, while frustrating, don’t require an immediate call. Dripping faucets, slow drains, or minor leaks can usually wait for a scheduled appointment. However, if a minor issue is getting worse, don’t ignore it—small leaks can turn into bigger problems over time.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.
