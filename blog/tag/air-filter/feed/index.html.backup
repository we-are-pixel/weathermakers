<p>Every single furnace has an air filter&#8211;or at least every <em>working</em> furnace has an air filter. This component is very important because it protects sensitive interior systems like wires, burners, and the heat exchanger from getting caked in dust and debris. The air filter isn&#8217;t designed to improve your air quality, but it can also do that as long as you do one simple task:</p>



<p><strong>Remember to change it every 1-3 months.</strong></p>



<p>This blog post is going to focus on the importance of a furnace&#8217;s air filter and how it works to generally keep the components of your system safe and efficient. The longer you go without replacing the air filter, the more likely it is that you&#8217;ll see a rise in heating bills and poor comfort throughout your home.</p>



<p>Do you still need to call us for <a href="/heating/furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">furnace repairs in Edmonton, AB</a> if something goes wrong? Of course! But if there&#8217;s nothing wrong right now, you might be able to stave off those future repairs by replacing the filter.</p>



<span id="more-2924"></span>



<h2>Why Air Filter Maintenance Matters</h2>



<p>The air filter in your furnace is designed to trap dust, debris, and other airborne particles before they circulate through your home. Over time, the filter becomes clogged with these contaminants, restricting airflow. This forces your furnace to work harder to push air through, which not only wastes energy but also reduces the system’s overall performance. A clean air filter ensures your furnace operates efficiently, saving you money on energy bills and extending the life of the system.</p>



<h2>Benefits During the Holiday Season</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Improved Indoor Air Quality</strong>. The holidays often mean more people in your home, which can stir up additional dust, allergens, and even germs. A clean air filter helps remove these particles from the air, creating a healthier environment for your family and guests. This is especially important if anyone in your home suffers from allergies or asthma.</li><li><strong>Reliable Heating for Guests</strong>. A clogged filter can lead to furnace malfunctions, which are the last thing you want during a holiday gathering. Replacing the filter reduces the risk of breakdowns, ensuring your home stays warm and welcoming for guests.</li><li><strong>Lower Energy Bills During a High-Usage Season</strong>. With the furnace running more frequently during colder months, an inefficient system can significantly drive up energy costs. A clean filter allows your furnace to heat your home more effectively, reducing energy consumption and keeping your utility bills in check.</li></ul>



<h2>How to Change Your Air Filter</h2>



<p>Replacing an air filter is a quick and easy task. Start by turning off the furnace, locating the filter compartment, and removing the old filter. Check your furnace manual for the correct size and type of replacement filter. Once the new filter is in place, turn the system back on and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a well-maintained furnace.</p>



<p>A little maintenance now can go a long way toward ensuring a warm, comfortable, and stress-free holiday season.</p>

<p>Before you scroll away from this blog, we&#8217;re not referring to air filtration systems or air purifiers in the title. Nope, we&#8217;re talking to any homeowner who has a central air conditioner, heat pump, or even a ductless mini split. Every single one of these systems has an air filter that needs to be cleaned on a regular basis.</p>



<p>And the best part is? <strong>We don&#8217;t need to be the ones to clean it. You can clean your air filter whenever you want.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, this isn&#8217;t a typical blog about hiring a professional for <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AC maintenance in Edmonton, AB</a> or scheduling a diagnosis with an expert. This is a bit of maintenance that you can do right now, and we&#8217;d argue, homeowners should be doing it on a very regular basis to avoid problems down the line.</p>

<h2>What the Air Filter Does</h2>



<p>The air filter is an interesting component in your air conditioner. Technically, it&#8217;s in your air ducts and not your AC unit, but it still counts as one of its most important components.</p>



<p>The air filter blocks our harmful contaminants like dust, debris, and pet dander. These contaminants are harmless to us (albeit uncomfortable to live with), but they can be extremely detrimental to your air conditioner and the cooling process.</p>



<p>The air filter keeps them from gunking up the coils and causing issues over time.</p>



<h2>The Problems With a Clogged Filter</h2>



<p>What kinds of issues can a clogged air filter cause? Here are a few:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Poor efficiency and increased energy consumption.</strong></li><li><strong>Uncomfortable temperatures and a reduction in the AC&#8217;s effectiveness.</strong></li><li><strong>Poor air quality.</strong></li><li><strong>Wear and tear.</strong></li></ul>



<p>All of these problems can come with an increased likelihood of a system breakdown and other issues that require professional repair.</p>



<h2>Changing the Filter: A Guide</h2>



<p>We could get really detailed with this kind of guide, but you&#8217;ll likely find that stuff in video form throughout the rest of the internet. We&#8217;d like to keep it short and simple while also reminding you that <strong>our team can walk you through this process when you schedule maintenance.</strong></p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s get right to it. How do you change your air filter?</p>



<ol><li>Locate the <strong>return air duct</strong> which funnels air into your air conditioner. This system should be marked with an arrow, or at least labeled correctly so you can find it.</li><li>There should be a flap which, when lifted, allows you to remove the air filter that is currently placed within the system.</li><li>Make sure you <strong>turn your air conditioner off before you remove the filter.</strong></li><li>Go ahead and remove the filter.</li><li>If the filter is reusable (i.e. plastic or some kind of durable material), then you can clean it off with a damp paper towel. Make sure it dries afterward.</li><li>If the filter is disposable, you can just throw it out and replace it with a new one.</li><li>When this is complete, just place the new filter back into the slot where the old one was. Try to make sure it&#8217;s facing the correct direction when doing so.</li></ol>



<p>At this point, turn your air conditioner back on and enjoy the comfort!</p>
