<p>You see drain-cleaning chemicals everywhere, from the hardware store to the grocery store. Their cultural prominence leads to some interesting questions that we get from customers, such as:</p>



<p><strong>If drain chemicals are everywhere, they must work in some way or another, right?</strong></p>



<p>We understand the logic to this question, but there are a few facts we need to cover to adequately answer this. In short, <strong>no, drain cleaning chemicals don&#8217;t work, </strong>but <em>work</em> is doing some serious heavy lifting in that sentence. When it comes to <a href="/plumbing/drain-lines/drain-cleaning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drain cleaning in Edmonton, AB,</a> the only thing that will comprehensively solve the problem of a clogged drain is calling our team for professional service.</p>



<p>Drain-cleaning chemicals won&#8217;t fix your problem, at least not permanently. And here&#8217;s why.</p>



<span id="more-2910"></span>



<h2>What Are Drain Chemicals?</h2>



<p>Drain chemicals are different blends of acidic or caustic materials that are <em>supposed</em> to melt away your drain-clogging materials through a chemical reaction. This would make sense, but in practice, it&#8217;s never really what ends up happening.</p>



<p>First, to understand why these chemicals are hazardous, we need to discuss their acidity or caustic nature. These chemicals can cause rashes on your skin and release powerful fumes that can be unhealthy to breathe in. Their acidic or caustic nature is what lets them break down materials that might be clogging your drain, but this comes with a whole other set of side effects that we&#8217;ll get into.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Wrong With Them?</h2>



<p>Want to know why you should stay away from drain-cleaning chemicals? Here are just five reasons.</p>



<ul><li><strong>They can corrode the inner lining of your pipes.</strong> These caustic or acidic chemicals can actually wear away at the pipe lining in your plumbing system. This means you&#8217;re statistically more likely to encounter leaks and mold issues over time as your pipes weaken.</li><li><strong>They release noxious fumes that can be unhealthy to breathe in.</strong> The fumes that these chemicals can release are not only uncomfortable and distasteful, but they&#8217;re also bad for your lungs, head, and nose when you breathe them in, as well as a burning sensation in your eyes. Touching the chemicals can also leave rashes on your hands.</li><li><strong>The fumes can make rooms unusable for days.</strong> Those fumes don&#8217;t go away easily once the chemicals are in your drain! Even if you open a window, a room might not be usable for a few days when the chemical is finally gone.</li><li><strong>These chemicals are bad for the local ecosystem.</strong> Where do you think these chemicals end up? Once they&#8217;re in your drain or your sewer system, they&#8217;ll likely end up in the public water supply where they can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem. Most water treatment facilities are used to conventional contaminants, not harsh chemicals.</li><li><strong>They don&#8217;t even work to remove clogs.</strong> Let&#8217;s face it, these chemicals don&#8217;t even work that well after all you might go through.</li></ul>



<p>You know what does work well, and nearly instantly? Hiring a plumber to clear your drain with a hydro jet or conventional plumbing equipment. We&#8217;ll be fast, efficient, and leave your home clean and ready to use.</p>
