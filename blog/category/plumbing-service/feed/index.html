<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="../../../blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20200625152917-0a0b92e1-cu_e260x180.jpg"><img width="260" height="179" src="../../../blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20200625152917-0a0b92e1-cu_e260x180.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3090"/></a></figure></div>


<p>Discovering a leak in your water heater can be frustrating—and potentially damaging to your home. Left unchecked, even a small leak can lead to mold, structural damage, and higher utility bills. Whether it&#8217;s a small drip or a growing puddle, you need to act fast to prevent water damage and restore your hot water supply. If you’ve noticed your <a href="/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters">water heater leaking in Edmonton,</a> here’s what to do next to protect your home and your peace of mind.</p>



<span id="more-3081"></span>



<h2>Step 1: Shut Off the Water Supply</h2>



<p>First things first: locate the cold water shut-off valve on your water heater. It’s typically found above the unit. Turn it off to prevent more water from entering the tank and making the leak worse. If the valve is stuck or difficult to reach, you may need to shut off your home’s main water supply instead.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Turn Off the Power or Gas</h2>



<p>For electric water heaters, switch off the breaker labeled “water heater” in your electrical panel. If you have a gas model, turn the gas valve to the “off” position. This step is crucial for safety—leaks and electricity or gas don’t mix.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Identify the Source of the Leak</h2>



<p>Leaks can happen for a number of reasons. Some of the most common sources include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Loose drain valves</strong></li><li><strong>Corroded or cracked tank</strong></li><li><strong>A faulty temperature and pressure relief (T&amp;P) valve</strong></li><li><strong>Leaky plumbing connections</strong></li></ul>



<p>Carefully inspect the unit. If water is dripping from the top, it could be a fitting. If it’s pooling around the base, it may be the tank itself, especially if it’s over 10 years old.</p>



<h2>Step 4: Drain the Tank</h2>



<p>If the leak is significant or the tank is full, draining it can help prevent further water damage. Connect a garden hose to the drain valve at the bottom of the tank and run the hose outside or to a floor drain. Open the valve and allow the tank to empty.<br><br><strong>Important:</strong> Be cautious—water inside may still be hot. Let the unit cool before draining if needed.</p>



<h2>Step 5: Call a Professional</h2>



<p>Some minor leaks can be fixed with a quick repair, tightening a valve, or replacing a faulty part. But if the tank itself is corroded or cracked, replacement is likely the only safe and long-term solution. In many cases, calling a professional is the best route to ensure the issue is diagnosed and resolved correctly the first time.<br><br>That’s where we come in. At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we know how stressful plumbing issues can be, especially when they disrupt your daily routine. Our licensed technicians are experienced in diagnosing and repairing all types of water heater problems, and we’ll give you honest advice on whether it’s worth repairing or replacing your system.<br><br>We also offer 24/7 emergency plumbing service—because leaks don’t wait for a convenient time.</p>



<h2>Don’t Wait—Take Action Today</h2>



<p>A leaking water heater won’t fix itself—and the longer you wait, the more damage it can cause. From minor repairs to full replacements, we’re here to make sure you’re never without hot water when you need it most.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<p>A leaking water heater can be a frustrating—and potentially costly—problem. Whether you notice a small puddle near the base or water dripping from the tank itself, it’s a sign that something isn’t right. Left untreated, a water heater leak can lead to water damage, mold growth, and even complete system failure. In this post, we’ll walk you through the common causes of water heater leaks, how to diagnose the problem, and what steps you should take right away. If you&#8217;re experiencing issues with your hot water system, it&#8217;s time to call the experts in <a href="/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water heater repair in Edmonton, AB.</a></p>



<span id="more-3030"></span>



<h2>Common Causes of a Leaking Water Heater</h2>



<h3>Loose Connections</h3>



<p>The most common source of leaks is a loose or faulty connection. Check the cold water inlet and hot water outlet pipes to make sure they are securely attached. Over time, fittings can corrode or loosen due to expansion and contraction, especially in older systems.</p>



<h3>Temperature &amp; Pressure Relief Valve (T&amp;P Valve)</h3>



<p>This valve is designed to release water if the tank’s pressure gets too high. If the valve is faulty or there’s excessive pressure, it may start leaking. Make sure the valve is not stuck open or clogged with sediment.</p>



<h3>Drain Valve Leaks</h3>



<p>Located near the bottom of the tank, the drain valve is used during maintenance to flush out sediment. If this valve is not tightly closed or has degraded over time, it can leak. A slow drip from the spout may mean it needs tightening or replacement.</p>



<h3>Internal Tank Corrosion</h3>



<p>If you notice water leaking from the bottom of the heater, internal corrosion could be the culprit. Over time, sediment builds up inside the tank and can corrode the lining, causing leaks. Unfortunately, once the tank is compromised, replacement is usually necessary.</p>



<h3>Condensation</h3>



<p>Sometimes, what looks like a leak is condensation, especially in colder climates like Edmonton. If your water heater is in a cool area and is working hard, moisture may form on the outside. This isn&#8217;t a sign of damage, but it can still create puddles and lead to confusion.</p>



<h2>What You Should Do Now</h2>



<h3>Turn Off the Power Supply</h3>



<p>For electric water heaters, shut off the power at the circuit breaker. If you have a gas model, switch the gas control valve to the &#8220;off&#8221; position.</p>



<h3>Shut Off the Water Supply</h3>



<p>Find the cold water shutoff valve (usually located at the top of the heater) and turn it off to prevent more water from entering the tank.</p>



<h3>Inspect the Source</h3>



<p>Use a flashlight to examine the unit. Check around valves, fittings, and the base of the tank. This will help you or your plumber quickly identify the issue.</p>



<h3>Call a Professional</h3>



<p>Unless the leak is due to something simple like condensation or a loose fitting, most water heater repairs are best left to professionals. Especially if the tank is damaged or old, trying to fix it yourself could make things worse. They have the tools and experience to fix the issue safely and prevent further damage.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="../../../blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="198" src="../../../blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13-300x198.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3003" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/th-13.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Plumbing problems can range from minor annoyances to full-blown emergencies. But how do you know when it’s time to call in a professional—immediately? Some issues can wait, while others require urgent attention to prevent serious damage to your home. Here’s how to tell the difference. If you’re facing a plumbing disaster, don’t wait. Quick action can save you from costly damage and stress. For<a href="/plumbing/general-plumbing/emergency-plumbing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> emergency plumbing in Edmonton, AB</a>, trust the experts to handle the situation fast and efficiently.</p>



<span id="more-2992"></span>



<h2>Burst Pipes &#8211; Act Fast!</h2>



<p>If a pipe bursts in your home, don’t hesitate—turn off your water supply and call a plumber right away. Burst pipes can quickly flood your home, causing thousands of dollars in damage. This is especially common in winter when freezing temperatures cause pipes to expand and crack. The longer you wait, the worse the situation gets, so immediate action is key.</p>



<h2>Sewage Backups &#8211; A Mess You Don&#8217;t Want to Handle</h2>



<p>Few things are worse than sewage backing up into your sinks, tubs, or toilets. Not only is it disgusting, but it also poses serious health risks. If you notice foul smells, slow drains, or water pooling around your floor drains, don’t ignore it. A sewage backup is a sign of a major blockage in your main sewer line, and it won’t clear up on its own. Call an emergency plumber to prevent further contamination and damage.</p>



<h2>No Water in Your Home</h2>



<p>If you turn on your faucets and nothing comes out, you’ve got a serious problem. A sudden loss of water can be caused by a major pipe leak, frozen pipes, or an issue with your main water line. Before calling a plumber, check with your neighbors to see if it’s a municipal issue. If not, you’ll need professional help to diagnose and fix the problem.</p>



<h2>Overflowing Toilets That Won&#8217;t Stop</h2>



<p>A single clogged toilet isn’t an emergency—unless plunging doesn’t work, and water keeps rising with every flush. An overflowing toilet can quickly turn into a disaster, damaging flooring and spreading bacteria. If shutting off the water valve behind the toilet doesn’t stop the flow, it’s time to call for help.</p>



<h2>Water Heater Leaks or No Hot Water</h2>



<p>A lack of hot water is more than just an inconvenience—it can indicate a failing water heater. If your water heater is leaking or making strange noises, it could be on the verge of a breakdown. Leaks from the tank can cause water damage and even lead to mold growth if not addressed quickly.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Not an Emergency?</h2>



<p>Some plumbing issues, while frustrating, don’t require an immediate call. Dripping faucets, slow drains, or minor leaks can usually wait for a scheduled appointment. However, if a minor issue is getting worse, don’t ignore it—small leaks can turn into bigger problems over time.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<p>You see drain-cleaning chemicals everywhere, from the hardware store to the grocery store. Their cultural prominence leads to some interesting questions that we get from customers, such as:</p>



<p><strong>If drain chemicals are everywhere, they must work in some way or another, right?</strong></p>



<p>We understand the logic to this question, but there are a few facts we need to cover to adequately answer this. In short, <strong>no, drain cleaning chemicals don&#8217;t work, </strong>but <em>work</em> is doing some serious heavy lifting in that sentence. When it comes to <a href="/plumbing/drain-lines/drain-cleaning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drain cleaning in Edmonton, AB,</a> the only thing that will comprehensively solve the problem of a clogged drain is calling our team for professional service.</p>



<p>Drain-cleaning chemicals won&#8217;t fix your problem, at least not permanently. And here&#8217;s why.</p>



<span id="more-2910"></span>



<h2>What Are Drain Chemicals?</h2>



<p>Drain chemicals are different blends of acidic or caustic materials that are <em>supposed</em> to melt away your drain-clogging materials through a chemical reaction. This would make sense, but in practice, it&#8217;s never really what ends up happening.</p>



<p>First, to understand why these chemicals are hazardous, we need to discuss their acidity or caustic nature. These chemicals can cause rashes on your skin and release powerful fumes that can be unhealthy to breathe in. Their acidic or caustic nature is what lets them break down materials that might be clogging your drain, but this comes with a whole other set of side effects that we&#8217;ll get into.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Wrong With Them?</h2>



<p>Want to know why you should stay away from drain-cleaning chemicals? Here are just five reasons.</p>



<ul><li><strong>They can corrode the inner lining of your pipes.</strong> These caustic or acidic chemicals can actually wear away at the pipe lining in your plumbing system. This means you&#8217;re statistically more likely to encounter leaks and mold issues over time as your pipes weaken.</li><li><strong>They release noxious fumes that can be unhealthy to breathe in.</strong> The fumes that these chemicals can release are not only uncomfortable and distasteful, but they&#8217;re also bad for your lungs, head, and nose when you breathe them in, as well as a burning sensation in your eyes. Touching the chemicals can also leave rashes on your hands.</li><li><strong>The fumes can make rooms unusable for days.</strong> Those fumes don&#8217;t go away easily once the chemicals are in your drain! Even if you open a window, a room might not be usable for a few days when the chemical is finally gone.</li><li><strong>These chemicals are bad for the local ecosystem.</strong> Where do you think these chemicals end up? Once they&#8217;re in your drain or your sewer system, they&#8217;ll likely end up in the public water supply where they can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem. Most water treatment facilities are used to conventional contaminants, not harsh chemicals.</li><li><strong>They don&#8217;t even work to remove clogs.</strong> Let&#8217;s face it, these chemicals don&#8217;t even work that well after all you might go through.</li></ul>



<p>You know what does work well, and nearly instantly? Hiring a plumber to clear your drain with a hydro jet or conventional plumbing equipment. We&#8217;ll be fast, efficient, and leave your home clean and ready to use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>DIY and Professional Plumber Solutions</h2>



<p>You know the signs&#8211;you find yourself standing in an inch of water during your morning shower. Or you bend down to rinse your toothbrush and get a sniff of musty leaf from the sink? Yes, it sounds like you have a clogged drain. Better to deal with it the moment you notice it, and the earlier you deal with it, the more options you have.</p>



<span id="more-1244"></span>



<h3>DIY Clogged Drain Solutions</h3>



<p>It’s best to determine what the clog is made of before choosing your solution. Also consider drain location and how you use the drain. Here’s a quick guide.</p>



<p>Kitchen clogs could be made of food particles, a stray sponge, peels, etc.<br>These clogs are almost always cleared with a drain snake that you can buy or rent from a home hardware store. Push it gently through the pipes until you meet the clog and then carefully turn it so the head can clear the clog. Flush thoroughly afterward.</p>



<p>It’s not recommended to snake through a waste disposal unit. Best to access the drain clean-out or via a second basin if you have one. If you suspect the waste disposal unit holds the clog, cut the power to it and see if you can fish out any materials using pliers or tongs. Never use your hands for this. You can also try turning the blades manually using an Allen key underneath the unit. If the clog is soft debris, sometimes a plunger works quicker than anything else. Do not use commercial drain cleaners as they can deteriorate some plastics.</p>



<p>Shower, bathtub and bathroom sink clogs are often made from a mix of hair, soap scum, hair product residue and toothpaste. Non chemical fixes include a mix of baking soda and white vinegar. Admittedly, it doesn’t work great for thick clogs, but regular use will keep buildup at bay.<br>Chemical solutions include drain cleaners. There are many on the market. Read and follow the directions exactly. These chemicals can be dangerous to humans, pipes and pets if used incorrectly.</p>



<p>Toilet clogs are often, well, excrement, toilet paper, or the accidental flushing of sanitary pads or other toiletries. If you have toddlers or dogs, don’t discount toys, watches or knick-knacks. You might be surprised at what you find in a toilet. A plunger will help with most “soft” clogs, and if that doesn’t work, the plumber’s snake we mentioned for kitchen sink clogs can clear blockages further down. Just be very gentle snaking through ceramic toilets as they’re more fragile than you might think.</p>



<p>Laundry drain clogs are almost always made of lint and hair. These clogs are easily pulled out of washing machine drain hoses, laundry sink drains and drain lines that are accessible. They often collect at joints and curves, so check there first.</p>



<h3>When to Call a Plumber</h3>



<p>If your DIY remedies don’t work or the fix doesn’t last, you could have more going on. There could be another clog further down past where your snake can reach, or perhaps there’s an issue in your plumbing stack, venting, house drain or sewer line. These are harder to diagnose, and if you find you just can’t clear a drain or section of pipe, call in a plumber who can better diagnose the whole house to better see the issue.</p>



<p>As well, if you maintain an eco-friendly home and have a stubborn clog, plumbers have a number of long-lasting, chemical-free solutions at the ready. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/emergency-plumbing.html">Don’t hesitate to call WeatherMakers for a home-friendly, green plumbing solution</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How Do I Keep My Appliances and Pipes Clear of Limescale?</h3>



<p>Hard water. We know the Edmonton area has it, but what is it and do we need to be concerned?</p>



<p>In short, hard water is water that has a higher than average amount of dissolved minerals. In our area, that’s mostly calcium and magnesium. The calcium and magnesium are not harmful to people or pets, but hard water can have annoying side effects and require some action on your part.</p>



<span id="more-1232"></span>



<p>Typical symptoms of hard water include:</p>



<ul><li>Regular soaps and detergents don’t clean as effectively.</li><li>Shampoos and soaps don’t rinse easily.</li><li>Cloudy or chalky deposits accumulate on your tub or shower tiles, showerheads, and the bottom of faucets.</li><li>Soap scum builds up quickly in showers and tubs.</li><li>Scaly deposits can build up in your drains, pipes and toilets.</li><li>Glasses and dishes may come out of your dishwasher with white or opaque spots.</li><li>Laundry may become stiff and bath towels less absorbent.</li></ul>



<h3>Preventive Action for Hard Water</h3>



<p>These annoyances are simply that, annoyances. There are special soaps, detergents and shampoos that are formulated to work better with hard water, and buying those will make a small difference. There are also <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/water-quality/water-softeners.html">whole home water softener systems</a> that will cure most of the issues, freeing you from buying multiple chemicals and products. Some bathtub and sink cleaners are specially formulated to reduce scum and scale buildup, so that takes care of that&#8211;with a little elbow grease.</p>



<p>For appliances that heat or run water, it’s recommended to give the areas that come in contact with water a little soak with white vinegar now and again. If you’ve noticed a bumpy buildup around your electric kettle’s heating element, for example, that’s the stuff we’re talking about. Regular soaks in white vinegar will take that back, and in appliances or humidifiers that are a bit harder to treat, look for special descalers that you can buy at grocery and home supply stores. Be sure to choose products with care. Don’t use industrial descalers in appliances that make food and drinks.</p>



<h3>Hard Water and Home Plumbing</h3>



<p>For your pipes, we need to get a bit more specific. Anywhere water is delivered or drained is at risk of accumulating deposits of calcium carbonate and other mineral salts. If your home has hard water, this limescale is likely to build up around the heating elements of a traditional storage hot water heater, and potentially in the heat exchanger of a tankless water heater. This can reduce the efficiency of your water heater, increasing your hot water energy bills over time. Draining these periodically can help reduce the build-up. Some tankless hot water heater manufacturers supply people-safe descalers that you can use to help keep them clean. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters.html">Learn more about tankless water heaters here.</a></p>



<p>Limescale can also build up inside your home’s pipes. Over long periods of time, this can lead to decreased water pressure as the supply flow becomes restricted. In serious cases, leaks happen as water pressure builds up behind blockages, and in the worst cases, clogged, corroded, cracked, or burst pipes can happen.</p>



<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>



<ul><li>Your home’s age matters. If your home was built after 1975, you likely won’t experience the worst of these problems because you have copper, PVC, or PEX pipe. These modern materials are more resistant to hard water corrosion and scaling.</li><li>If your home was built before 1975, you could have galvanized steel pipes, which do run the risk of attracting limescale over time.</li><li>If your home was built in the WWII era or before, you could have low-quality galvanized steel pipes, or pipes of even older materials, in which case, you should call an experienced plumber to inspect your home and recommend if your pipes should be descaled or replaced.</li></ul>



<p>It may take years for limescale buildup to cause noticeable problems, but, if you have hard water and galvanized pipes, it may have been accumulating for many years. Maybe you&#8217;ve already noticed a slight decrease in your water pressure? If so, we’re here to help.</p>



<h3>Next Steps</h3>



<p>If you notice some of the obvious signs of hard water in your home, the best thing to do is get more information. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing.html">A qualified plumber can give you a more accurate reading of your home&#8217;s water hardness</a> and conduct a whole house plumbing inspection to:</p>



<ul><li>Inspect your water heater for scaling and flush out any accumulated sediment.</li><li>Inspect your other major water-using appliances for buildup.</li><li>Inspect your pipes for signs of limescale obstruction, corrosion, and leaks.</li></ul>



<h3>Remedies for Hard Water Issues</h3>



<p>We mentioned some DIY remedies above, and we highly recommend them for regular maintenance of your appliances, pipes, drains and faucets. But if your water is very hard or if you have a lot of buildup in your pipes, your home may benefit from a more comprehensive solution:</p>



<ul><li>A whole house water softener, water conditioner, or reverse osmosis filtration system can remove minerals from your water or prevent limescale.</li><li>Descaling is not possible or advisable in all situations, but it’s sometimes useful to restore water pressure and prevent future problems. Your plumber will be able to advise you. Do not do this yourself unless you have plumbing experience.</li><li>If your home still has galvanized piping, consider upgrading to a more modern material.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tankless water heaters provide instant hot water, and so are known as demand, on-demand, or instantaneous water heaters. They’ve become a popular alternative to traditional hot water heaters that both heat and store water for later use. Tankless heaters don’t store any water&#8211;the water flows through as you need it.</p>



<span id="more-1224"></span>



<p>So, aside from the instant hot water that tankless water heaters provide, what are the advantages?</p>



<p><strong>Overall efficiency&#8211;</strong>no water is stored, so no water needs to be kept warm, as you would see in a typical hot water heater.<br><strong>Smaller size&#8211;</strong>again, since they don’t store water, they are smaller units that can sit flush against a wall or support. They can free up a lot of space in your home, and small, or secondary point-of-use units, can even be placed under sinks or near thirsty appliances.<br><strong>Long lifespans&#8211;</strong>these units tend to last longer than storage hot water heaters. Tankless water heaters may be warrantied for 10 years and last for 20 to 25 years if bought from a reputable manufacturer and installed by a professional.<br><strong>Replaceable parts&#8211;</strong>most parts in a tankless water heater are easily replaceable.<br><strong>Near-endless supply&#8211;</strong>depending on the flow rating of the unit, an entire home can enjoy an endless supply of hot water.</p>



<p>That all sounds great, so why doesn’t every home come with one of these? To understand that, let’s take a look at the math and the requirements.</p>



<h2>Efficiency Savings vs. Total Overall Cost</h2>



<p>The heating efficiency of tankless water heaters needs to be balanced with the higher front-end costs that come with them&#8211;both for purchase and installation. Tankless heaters are more expensive to purchase than a conventional water heater, and they can be more expensive to install. If your home is large, you might find that you need more than one unit to meet water use needs, which can more than double your costs right from the get go.</p>



<p>Another factor to consider is the energy source that your tankless water heater will use. If it’s electricity, in Alberta, that could get expensive, especially if the utility becomes unregulated. A tankless water heater running on natural gas is a better overall idea, as the resource is affordable and plentiful in our area. One point to note is that gas heaters require venting, which will add to installation costs. A clever option for a large home is to run your main unit on gas and any small, auxiliary units on electricity.</p>



<h3>Making the Call</h3>



<p>So, when making the decision of <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters.html">whether to go with storage or tankless water heaters</a>, you’ll have to consider how much water you need, how much hot water you will need at your highest consumption point any given day, and from that you’ll determine what size unit or units you will need.</p>



<p>From there, the math is cost of purchase, cost of installation, cost to run over its lifespan. Add those estimates up and compare against the figures for a new hot water heater.</p>



<p>If the math doesn’t convince you, consider your home’s layout. What makes more sense, a smaller tankless unit, or do you have plenty of space to spare?</p>



<h3>If You Have Questions, We Have Answers</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot to consider when choosing whether to switch to a tankless water heater. But you don&#8217;t have to decide on your own. WeatherMakers plumbers have experience designing plumbing systems for homes, businesses and some industrial set-ups. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message.html">Call WeatherMakers today</a> and we’ll explore your options with you.
