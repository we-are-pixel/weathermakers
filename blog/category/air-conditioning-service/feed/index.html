<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20240531110515-40e8f34f-cu_e260x180.jpg"><img width="259" height="180" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20240531110515-40e8f34f-cu_e260x180.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3077"/></a></figure></div>


<p>When the summer sun turns up the heat, your comfort at home becomes a top priority. If you&#8217;re exploring your cooling options and considering <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation">AC installation in Edmonton</a>, inverter air conditioners should be at the top of your list—and for good reason. At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we understand the importance of staying cool and energy-efficient all summer long. That’s why we recommend inverter ACs to our clients who want the best in performance, comfort, and savings.</p>



<span id="more-3067"></span>



<h2>What Makes Inverter ACs Different?</h2>



<p>Unlike traditional air conditioners that run on a simple on-off cycle, inverter ACs use advanced technology to adjust their compressor speed based on your cooling needs. This means they don&#8217;t have to power up and down constantly. Instead, they maintain a consistent temperature, giving you smoother, quieter, and more efficient performance. They also help maintain better humidity control, making your indoor environment feel fresher and less sticky even on the hottest days.<br><br>The result? A home that cools faster, stays cooler longer, and uses less energy, without the uncomfortable temperature swings that come with older AC systems.</p>



<h2>Energy Efficiency That Pays Off</h2>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of inverter ACs is their energy efficiency. Because they can regulate how much power they use depending on the situation, they consume significantly less electricity than non-inverter models. That means you’ll see a noticeable drop in your energy bills—even during those peak summer months when your AC is working hardest.<br><br>Plus, many inverter AC units are ENERGY STAR® certified, which not only helps reduce your carbon footprint but may also qualify you for local energy rebates.</p>



<h2>Quieter Operation, Better Sleep</h2>



<p>Have you ever been woken up in the middle of the night by your air conditioner clicking on? Inverter ACs operate at variable speeds, which significantly reduces noise. The smooth, steady airflow is ideal for bedrooms, nurseries, and other spaces where quiet is essential.</p>



<h2>Longer Lifespan, Fewer Repairs</h2>



<p>Inverter technology puts less strain on your system because it avoids the constant start-stop cycle of traditional ACs. This gentler operation helps extend the life of your unit and reduces wear and tear, meaning fewer service calls and lower maintenance costs over time. In the long run, this translates into real peace of mind, knowing your investment is built to last.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Edmonton’s Climate</h2>



<p>Edmonton summers can get hot, but they&#8217;re also unpredictable. Inverter ACs are great at adjusting quickly to changing temperatures, keeping your home comfortable no matter what the weather throws your way. When paired with professional AC installation in Edmonton, you’ll enjoy cooling that’s not just powerful, but smart.</p>



<h2>The Right Choice for Your Home</h2>



<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we believe your home deserves the best. That’s why we only install and recommend products we’d trust in our own homes. Inverter ACs offer unmatched benefits in terms of comfort, efficiency, and durability. If you&#8217;re thinking about upgrading your cooling system this summer, we’re here to help guide you through every step, from selection to expert installation.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/study.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/study-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2906" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/study-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/study-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/study-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/study-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/study.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Your heat pump has three main responsibilities–to cool your home, heat your home, and to use energy efficiently. If it messes up one of those three responsibilities, then it might be time to replace or fix the system. After all, why have a heat pump if it’s not going to keep your home comfy or be affordable to run?</p>



<p>This is where today’s topic becomes immensely important. <strong>Heat pump problems can impact efficiency, and they actually do a lot more harm to the efficient operation of your system than you might think.</strong></p>



<p>Want to know how? Or perhaps you’re not quite convinced of this fact yet? Regardless, follow through this blog for some information on how efficiency is impacted by a problem, and for other methods that can keep your system running at peak efficiency. Just make sure you schedule any work for your <a href="/service-areas/katy-tx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heat pump in Edmonton, AB </a>with us!</p>



<span id="more-2905"></span>



<h2>Detecting a Problem</h2>



<p>First, before we can talk about how problems impact efficiency, we need to determine whether your heat pump is having problems of its own or not. This can be tricky to do online.</p>



<p><strong>For an accurate diagnosis that doesn’t rely on subjective material, schedule an appointment with our team. </strong>We train to specifically diagnose HVAC issues, so you don’t have to worry about whether your system is running well or if it’s encountering problems.</p>



<p>But for anyone else, here are a few signs your heat pump is in need of repair.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Strange or loud noises</strong></li><li><strong>Foul odors like a dirty sock smell or a sweet scent</strong></li><li><strong>Constant shut-offs and tripping circuits</strong></li><li><strong>It’s not meeting the demand on your thermostat</strong></li><li><strong>There’s no airflow coming from the vents</strong></li></ul>



<p>If these points sound at all familiar, then you’ve got a problem that needs repair. Now let’s get to why this might be more important to schedule than you think.</p>



<h2>How Issues Impact Efficiency</h2>



<p>A heat pump problem is usually caused by a component that’s either failing or broken. For instance, a <strong>rattling </strong>sound can be caused by a loose screw or a component that’s broken free and is bouncing around the housing of the unit.</p>



<p>While this might sound like a small problem that can wait, the issue comes from this component bouncing <em>into</em> one of the other more sensitive components of your system. This can not only hamper the system’s effectiveness but ruin the efficiency of your heat pump.</p>



<p>For example, if this component bumps into the coils of your system, it might hamper the system’s ability to draw in heat and make it run for longer cycles, adding a substantial amount of money to your monthly cooling bills. And that’s just one type of problem!</p>



<h2>Maintenance and Repairs Are Key</h2>



<p>First, if you’re experiencing any of the above-mentioned problems, make sure you schedule repairs to get it fixed. In the meantime, if your heat pump seems to be running just fine, you’ll also want to schedule routine maintenance on a yearly basis. We can clean and inspect the unit to ensure it works as efficiently as possible. Don’t pay more than you have to for cooling or heating in Edmonton, AB!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ductless.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ductless-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2901" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ductless-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ductless-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ductless.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Ductless HVAC has entered our lexicon as a new way of dealing with heating and cooling. For instance, we still see old ducted systems in movies and TV shows, even though a growing percentage of the population is starting to rely on ductless mini splits which will soon be just as common.</p>



<p><strong>The truth is that not enough people are familiar with these systems enough to be comfortable seeing them often. </strong>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, it’s time to change things up!</p>



<p>We’re going to discuss the unique pros and cons of <a href="/air-conditioning/ductless-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ductless cooling in Edmonton, AB</a> so that our customers in particular can be more familiar with these systems. They’ll feel less foreign and you’ll even be able to spot them at someone else’s house when you come into contact with them.</p>



<span id="more-2899"></span>



<h2>The Pros of Ductless Cooling</h2>



<p>Ductless HVAC systems have some pretty remarkable advantages. As we break these down remember that they heavily depend on the way your home is formatted and your unique comfort preferences. But we promise you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Exceptional efficiency.</strong> Did you know that a substantial amount of wasted heating or cooling comes from your ductwork? An HVAC system is never going to be 100% efficient when it has to send that air through ducts. Those ducts can leak even through tiny holes that are impossible to detect with the naked eye. Luckily, ductless systems avoid that fate and have superior efficiency rates because of it.</li><li><strong>Convenient operation.</strong> Put these air handlers in rooms where they&#8217;re most conveniently accessed for a strategic approach to home comfort.</li><li><strong>Spectacular temperature control.</strong> Are you constantly fighting over the thermostat in your house? Each air handler in a ductless system can have a different temperature threshold.</li><li><strong>They work even when they don&#8217;t.</strong> When one air handler breaks down, the others will continue to work while you get that one fixed up. This is a unique benefit to these systems.</li><li><strong>Minimal installation upkeep. </strong>Don&#8217;t get us wrong, you should still hire a professional technician to install your ductless heat pump. The outdoor unit needs to be properly connected to the indoor air handlers. But you don&#8217;t need to worry about an extensive installation of ductwork, which can cut down the set-up time considerably.</li></ul>



<h2>The Cons of Ductless Cooling</h2>



<p>In trying to be as fair as possible, we&#8217;d like to present some downsides so customers are aware of them if they decide to purchase these systems.</p>



<ul><li><strong>They&#8217;re more expensive.</strong> Ductless mini splits are more expensive to install than other conventional heating or cooling systems. Their efficiency is usually worth the cost, but that high initial investment can be a dealbreaker for some homeowners on a budget.</li><li><strong>They can turn a heating or cooling system obsolete.</strong> If you&#8217;re only replacing your air conditioner or heater, they might be a waste. These systems are heat pumps, which means they both heat and cool your home. Replacing only one system might render the other obsolete and waste the money you spent on that unit.</li><li><strong>They rely on electricity.</strong> If electricity prices are high in your neighborhood, you might end up paying more to run this system than a gas furnace during the winter. But when it comes to air conditioners, this point doesn&#8217;t matter as much.</li></ul>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule a consultation</a> with WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing&nbsp;to see if a ductless system is right for you.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/calendar.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="225" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/calendar-300x225.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2895" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/calendar-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/calendar-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/calendar-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/calendar-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/calendar.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Nothing feels worse than being scammed. It&#8217;s arguably one of the most embarrassing and humiliating experiences to go through, especially when there&#8217;s not much recourse. That&#8217;s where the idea for this blog came from since we pride ourselves on being a reliable, family-owned business in Edmonton. We&#8217;ve even won the prestigious Better Business Bureau 65 Years of Trust Club award which, not to brag, means we know a thing or two about good business practices.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the HVAC service industry is riddled with amateurs and scammers who will take advantage of customers. But with our help, you can avoid them and hire only a team of licensed professionals to provide you with <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-maintenance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air conditioning service in Edmonton, AB.</a> Relax, take a deep breath, and follow our guide to avoid being scammed in the future.</p>



<span id="more-2894"></span>



<h2>Unlicensed Technicians</h2>



<p><strong>Our technicians are</strong> <strong>licensed</strong>, which means they&#8217;ve gone through rigorous training to be able to call themselves technicians. These exams and courses are in-depth and help us understand not only how air conditioning systems work, but also how heat pumps work and other technology that&#8217;s up and coming in the HVAC industry. Every technician who is selling their work should be licensed and trained in the relevant industry technology.</p>



<p>Therefore it&#8217;s a pretty big red flag if you meet an unlicensed technician. Don&#8217;t get us wrong, plenty of retired HVAC technicians have expired licenses and that&#8217;s fine, but anyone without a license who is currently repairing or addressing HVAC system concerns is likely doing so under the table and it could be a scam.</p>



<h2>Uninsured Work</h2>



<p>Almost all reputable HVAC technicians are insured. This means that if something goes wrong on your property, either your HVAC system gets damaged or a technician gets injured for whatever reason, they can file a claim and have that covered without involving the customer. This is a big deal.</p>



<p>An amateur working on your air conditioner is a big risk. If something happens, you could be the sole person held liable for that damage. An uninsured technician is a risky investment and we&#8217;d go as far as to consider it almost a scam.</p>



<h2>Payment Before Work Is Done</h2>



<p>The only time a professional technician will ask for money before work is done is if they require a deposit for a large system installation. These can be multiple thousands of dollars in some cases, so a deposit or prepayment would make sense&#8211;but these are labeled strictly and you receive a receipt.</p>



<p>Any AC repair technician who asks for payment before any work is done is giving off big red flags. Most often a technician will give customers an estimate so they can know what the cost will be and prepare, but it&#8217;s unprofessional to ask for money before the work is done.</p>



<h2>Go With Your Gut</h2>



<p>You should never feel pressured to choose an HVAC technician, no matter what they say or do. High-pressure sales tactics and conveniently low prices can be hard to deal with, but you should always be comfortable with the work you invest in. Work with our team to feel good from start to finish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="200" height="300" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2890" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AC-repair.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>What is an AC installer, and are they different from an AC technician? Well, the major difference is in specialization. <strong>An AC installer is someone who specializes in installing and setting up your new air conditioning technology. </strong>Technicians, on the other hand, are specialists in diagnosing and repairing a problem in your air conditioner.</p>



<p>So, some of the strategies you might employ when searching for an HVAC technician won&#8217;t necessarily work the same when trying to find an installer. The jobs are different and the specific professionals that do the work might be different.</p>



<p>How can you specifically prepare for AC installation, and how can you choose the best <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air conditioning installer in Edmonton, AB?</a> Keep reading to learn more.</p>



<span id="more-2889"></span>



<h2>System Specialization</h2>



<p>First, you want to hire a team that&#8217;s got system specialization up their sleeve because you might not know the kind of AC you want to install yet. There are many different kinds of air conditioners, from central AC units to ductless heat pumps and centralized heat pumps. Each of these requires a very precise kind of installation that only a licensed and knowledgeable AC installer knows how to do.</p>



<p>But some companies don&#8217;t have this kind of specialized approach. You might be in a bit of trouble if you decide to purchase a heat pump for better efficiency and heating properties, only to hire an installer who has experience solely with central AC units. This is a bad situation and one you&#8217;ll want to avoid.</p>



<p><strong>Make sure you check with your HVAC installer to see what systems they&#8217;ve installed before and if they&#8217;re comfortable with the setup of your unique system.</strong></p>



<h2>Knowledge of Unique Setups</h2>



<p>Every home is different. Some homes are old and set up specifically for one kind of unit. Other modern homes are designed better for ductless AC units. This can heavily impact the installation process to the point of making it take much longer if the installer isn&#8217;t prepared for your unique situation.</p>



<p>Choose an AC installer who has experience with unique home setups. Tell them the first moment you can about how your home might be different from the average home, and where you might need some expertise. A trained and experienced AC installer will be able to figure this stuff out for you, as long as you&#8217;re upfront with them about your home situation.</p>



<h2>Load Calculation</h2>



<p>This is a big part of AC installation and something you just can&#8217;t afford to have done incorrectly. <strong>Load calculation </strong>includes the precise measurement of your home&#8217;s air volume for the specific AC unit you get installed.</p>



<p>Think about it, your air conditioner can come in different sizes, and it needs to be sized specifically for the air volume in your home. This can only be done when we measure the cubic footage of your indoor space, which can depend on a lot of things from tall ceilings to long hallways.</p>



<p>Luckily, this comes with training and our team can get this done by the book every time.</p>



<p>There are other important metrics for an AC installer to consider, but everything else comes with choosing the right team. Skip all of these steps by just working with our team of qualified AC installers for your next big purchase.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AC.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AC-300x200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2885" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AC-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AC-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AC-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AC-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AC.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Maintenance is usually a topic we reserve for springtime when temperatures are mild and our schedules are wide open. Now, we’re dealing with heatwave after heatwave and customers calling our hotline on a daily basis. But we think it’s important that we relay one important fact to our customers–<strong>it’s never too late for maintenance.</strong></p>



<p>It’s true! Whether your central air conditioner missed one maintenance appointment or has never been maintained before, we promise that this service can be important right now. Sure, it might be a bit trickier to pencil you into our busy schedule, but we can make it work.</p>



<p>Keep reading to learn why <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-maintenance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AC maintenance in Edmonton, AB</a> is valuable even during the hottest months of the summer.</p>



<span id="more-2884"></span>



<h2>Maintenance Requires Consistency</h2>



<p>We want to level with you for a moment. Air conditioning maintenance is important, but it’s not something that’s incredibly time-sensitive. Compared to AC repairs, which need to be done very quickly to address a budding problem inside of your system, air conditioning maintenance is something that requires consistency.</p>



<p>When you hear the word <strong>consistency</strong>, what do you think of? Do you think of going to the gym or getting your car’s oil changed? These are things that need to be done on a regular basis, but it doesn’t really matter what season you do them. AC maintenance fits in that category. It’s vital for your AC’s health and your home comfort, but it can be done in spring, summer, fall, and even winter!</p>



<h2>It Doesn’t Matter the Season</h2>



<p>Notice how we said AC maintenance can be done in winter? It’s true! It’s never too late to invest in AC maintenance.</p>



<p>So, if you’ve skipped out on maintenance this year, we’d urge you to set up an appointment with our team of professionals ASAP. Even if it’s in a month when the heatwaves die down, at least you’ll have a visit on the books so you can rest easy.</p>



<h2>Avoid Repairs and Get Peace of Mind</h2>



<p>One of the best reasons to invest in maintenance is to avoid repairs. If you’re concerned about your air conditioner to the point where it’s stressing you out, then maintenance is going to be your best friend.</p>



<p>This isn’t a strange occurrence, it happens all the time. In particularly hot summers with routine heatwaves, customers can truly understand how much their AC systems keep them comfortable and sane on a regular basis. If something were to happen to this constant stream of cooling, your life might be dramatically halted. AC maintenance helps to stop repairs from popping up unexpectedly, giving an AC technician access to your system to make sure it’s in good shape.</p>



<p>There’s another benefit you get from this kind of routine service–<strong>peace of mind</strong>. Sleep easier, be more relaxed, and relieve stress by knowing that your AC is in good hands, even when it doesn’t need to be repaired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mini-split.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" width="225" height="300" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mini-split-225x300.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2880" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mini-split-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mini-split-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mini-split.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Ductless air conditioning and heating systems represent a new way of thinking about comfort. They don’t use air ducts, as the name implies, and they run at peak efficiency levels that customers are just now discovering, which means they can save big on their energy bills.</p>



<p>Ductless systems have a ton of unique advantages and reasons for an initial purchase. But they’re not a one-size-fits-all solution for everyone. For reasons that we’ll get into below, a <a href="/air-conditioning/ductless-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ductless HVAC system in Edmonton, AB</a> is only going to be good for certain customers, and a more conventional system like a ducted heat pump or a central air conditioner might be a better choice for others.</p>



<p>How do you know which category you fit into? Let’s figure it out together!</p>



<span id="more-2879"></span>



<h2>The Pros of a Ductless System</h2>



<p>Let’s start with the best part. If you’ve done even a little bit of research on ductless systems and think they might be perfect for your home, then you’ll be excited to hear about some of these perks they offer.</p>



<ul><li><strong>No ducts, no problems. </strong>As we mentioned earlier, ductless HVAC systems don’t need ducts. This is a big deal since smaller homes usually don’t have room for ducts, and duct installation can be expensive on its own.</li><li><strong>Superb efficiency. </strong>Since ductless systems don’t use air ducts, they don’t risk leaking any air, which means 100% of the treated air ends up right where you can feel it. This maximizes their efficiency and makes them cost less over time.</li><li><strong>Customized comfort. </strong>Each air handler can be set to a different temperature threshold, meaning your bedroom can be a different temperature than your kitchen or living room.</li><li><strong>Heat pump technology. </strong>Since they’re heat pumps, ductless systems can function as cooling and heating units, giving you year-round comfort.</li><li><strong>They continue to work when there’s a problem. </strong>When one air handler breaks down, you can rest assured knowing that the others will continue to work while you get that one fixed.</li></ul>



<h2>The Cons of a Ductless System</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks to a ductless system. But the good news is that there are other HVAC systems that can solve these problems easily.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Higher investment cost. </strong>Ductless systems do end up costing more to install than other conventional heating or cooling systems, like central air conditioners or furnaces. But this takes into account the fact that they are two systems in one.</li><li><strong>They have a particular aesthetic. </strong>Some people just don’t like the look of air handlers mounted on the wall or ceiling.</li><li><strong>They require consistent maintenance. </strong>Ductless heat pumps require maintenance twice a year in order to remain as efficient as they should be.</li><li><strong>Electricity prices can affect monthly costs</strong>. If electricity is expensive where you live, then it could cost more to run per month. But this is true for any air conditioning system.</li></ul>



<h2>Making the Right Call</h2>



<p>Our team can work with you to ensure that your home gets the perfect solution you’re happy with. Don’t stress out trying to make the right call, call Weathermakers instead.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sound.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sound-300x200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2876" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sound-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sound-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sound-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sound-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sound.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Air conditioners, when working correctly can often just make a clicking sound and a whir as they send air gently through the vents of your home. Rarely do they make sounds beyond that, and when they do, it’s usually a sign that something is wrong.</p>



<p>Now, we don’t want to stress any of our customers out, so we’ll make things as easy as possible. Most issues that give off strange or uncomfortable noises can be fixed by a professional, like the ones on our team. Just schedule an appointment and let us do the rest.</p>



<p>But for everyone who might be a bit curious, vigilance is key. The earlier you can detect an issue in your air conditioner using your ears, the more likely you’ll be to get it taken care of affordably with <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-repair.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air conditioning repair in Edmonton, AB.</a></p>



<span id="more-2875"></span>



<h2>Problematic Sounds</h2>



<p>Not every sound signifies a problem. Noises like the whooshing of air from the vents and the quick click of the system turning on when the thermostat signals too it, are all signs that the system is working as intended. But the following noises are never good to hear, not even if they’re happening on a mildly warm day compared to a heatwave.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Hissing and bubbling. </strong>An air conditioner that starts hissing or bubbling is likely leaking refrigerant. This chemical is the lifeblood of your air conditioner and it’s required for the system to work effectively. Without refrigerant, your air conditioner basically becomes an oversized fan.</li><li><strong>Grinding. </strong>An air conditioner that’s grinding is likely having issues with the compressor. This component consumes the most electricity and is responsible for pressurizing the refrigerant. This is never a good sign and requires repairs immediately.</li><li><strong>Clanking or rattling. </strong>Clanking or rattling can often correspond to a component that is loose or a screw that’s come apart. This might not sound like a bad issue, but that loose component can bump into one that’s sensitive and expensive, leading to further issues down the line.</li><li><strong>Constant clicking. </strong>A click for the system to start up or turn off is normal. But multiple clicks can insinuate that your air conditioner has an issue with the capacitors.</li><li><strong>Buzzing. </strong>Like the last problem, buzzing can also indicate a problem with your air conditioner’s electrical components. Frayed wires, burnt out components, and even an issue with the thermostat can lead to buzzing.</li><li><strong>Squealing. </strong>A loose fan motor belt can easily cause the system to start squealing. Don’t neglect this issue just because it’s coming from the fan of your system, it still needs to be fixed before it breaks.</li></ul>



<p>Remember, only a licensed professional has what it takes to address these issues head-on.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AC-Wrench.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AC-Wrench-300x200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2871" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AC-Wrench-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AC-Wrench-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AC-Wrench-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AC-Wrench-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AC-Wrench.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>For the uninitiated, air conditioning repairs aren&#8217;t always going to cut it when it comes to fixing your problems. Repairs imply that your air conditioner is in okay shape <em>to begin with</em>. But air conditioners that are either too old, too broken, or too inefficient are often not worth the repair cost and are not what we would consider <em>in good shape</em>.</p>



<p>But how do you know if your air conditioner is on its way out? The signs aren&#8217;t always obvious, and it might require some digging, but there is an answer out there. We will help you get to the bottom of this conundrum.</p>



<p>Just remember&#8211;you can&#8217;t avoid <a href="/air-conditioning/central-air-conditioners.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">central AC replacement in Edmonton, AB.</a> Every AC has a lifespan limit and will need to be replaced eventually. But you can schedule this with our team for an easy and reliable experience.</p>



<span id="more-2870"></span>



<h2>Efficiency Ain&#8217;t What It Used to Be</h2>



<p>Efficiency is a core part of your air conditioner. AC systems run for the majority of a hot day, which means they&#8217;re consistently using electricity. The less electricity they use, the less they cost month-to-month, which directly impacts your bills. But efficiency can also be a metric to determine whether your system is on its way out.</p>



<p>If your air conditioner costs too much to run, or it&#8217;s started running less efficiently on a regular basis, then it could be due to multiple components being worn down. A system replacement can alleviate this problem easily.</p>



<h2>Constant Problems</h2>



<p>One or two problems can usually be fixed with prompt repairs. But constant problems, like a repair call every single year, can usually signal that it&#8217;s time for your air conditioner to be replaced.</p>



<p>Think about it this way&#8211;keeping this AC unit is just going to be more frustrating in the future as you continue to call for repairs. A newer AC with all new components is going to last for a long time and likely won&#8217;t need nearly as many repairs in the first few years.</p>



<h2>It Doesn&#8217;t Keep You Comfortable</h2>



<p>Does your air conditioner do a poor job of meeting the demand set on your thermostat? Then regardless of what&#8217;s wrong, you might want to think about replacement. AC systems should be sized and installed according to your preferences and the size of your home. If it can&#8217;t meet the cooling demand, then something is seriously wrong that might not be fixable with simple repairs.</p>



<h2>The 10-15 Year Age Range</h2>



<p>This one is simple&#8211;air conditioners are only meant to last 10-15 years. Beyond this range, all bets are off and you could see costs rise substantially from inefficiency to increased repairs.</p>



<h2>It Just Doesn&#8217;t Work at All!</h2>



<p>This might seem like a no-brainer, but a lot of customers will still try to repair an air conditioner that just doesn&#8217;t turn on at all. This might make sense if the system is still relatively new and the problem is just a simple component failure, but most of the time with older systems, the root of the problem has to do with its age and multiple component failures.</p>



<p>This is what we would consider a <strong>full system breakdown</strong> and something that can often warrant an entire replacement. It&#8217;s an unfortunate thing to be surprised by, but it&#8217;s better than trying to get it fixed repeatedly with no lasting results!</p>

<p>Before you scroll away from this blog, we&#8217;re not referring to air filtration systems or air purifiers in the title. Nope, we&#8217;re talking to any homeowner who has a central air conditioner, heat pump, or even a ductless mini split. Every single one of these systems has an air filter that needs to be cleaned on a regular basis.</p>



<p>And the best part is? <strong>We don&#8217;t need to be the ones to clean it. You can clean your air filter whenever you want.</strong></p>



<p>Yep, this isn&#8217;t a typical blog about hiring a professional for <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-maintenance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AC maintenance in Edmonton, AB</a> or scheduling a diagnosis with an expert. This is a bit of maintenance that you can do right now, and we&#8217;d argue, homeowners should be doing it on a very regular basis to avoid problems down the line.</p>



<p>Want to learn more about this component? Keep reading and we&#8217;ll get to the bottom of it.</p>



<span id="more-2865"></span>



<h2>What the Air Filter Does</h2>



<p>The air filter is an interesting component in your air conditioner. Technically, it&#8217;s in your air ducts and not your AC unit, but it still counts as one of its most important components.</p>



<p>The air filter blocks our harmful contaminants like dust, debris, and pet dander. These contaminants are harmless to us (albeit uncomfortable to live with), but they can be extremely detrimental to your air conditioner and the cooling process.</p>



<p>The air filter keeps them from gunking up the coils and causing issues over time.</p>



<h2>The Problems With a Clogged Filter</h2>



<p>What kinds of issues can a clogged air filter cause? Here are a few:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Poor efficiency and increased energy consumption.</strong></li><li><strong>Uncomfortable temperatures and a reduction in the AC&#8217;s effectiveness.</strong></li><li><strong>Poor air quality.</strong></li><li><strong>Wear and tear.</strong></li></ul>

<h2>Changing the Filter: A Guide</h2>



<p>We could get really detailed with this kind of guide, but you&#8217;ll likely find that stuff in video form throughout the rest of the internet. We&#8217;d like to keep it short and simple while also reminding you that <strong>our team can walk you through this process when you schedule maintenance.</strong></p>



<p>So, let&#8217;s get right to it. How do you change your air filter?</p>



<ol><li>Locate the <strong>return air duct</strong> which funnels air into your air conditioner. This system should be marked with an arrow, or at least labeled correctly so you can find it.</li><li>There should be a flap which, when lifted, allows you to remove the air filter that is currently placed within the system.</li><li>Make sure you <strong>turn your air conditioner off before you remove the filter.</strong></li><li>Go ahead and remove the filter.</li><li>If the filter is reusable (i.e. plastic or some kind of durable material), then you can clean it off with a damp paper towel. Make sure it dries afterward.</li><li>If the filter is disposable, you can just throw it out and replace it with a new one.</li><li>When this is complete, just place the new filter back into the slot where the old one was. Try to make sure it&#8217;s facing the correct direction when doing so.</li></ol>



<p>At this point, turn your air conditioner back on and enjoy the comfort!</p>
