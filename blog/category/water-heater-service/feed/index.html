<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="../../../blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20200625152917-0a0b92e1-cu_e260x180.jpg"><img width="260" height="179" src="../../../blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20200625152917-0a0b92e1-cu_e260x180.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3090"/></a></figure></div>


<p>Discovering a leak in your water heater can be frustrating—and potentially damaging to your home. Left unchecked, even a small leak can lead to mold, structural damage, and higher utility bills. Whether it&#8217;s a small drip or a growing puddle, you need to act fast to prevent water damage and restore your hot water supply. If you’ve noticed your <a href="/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters">water heater leaking in Edmonton,</a> here’s what to do next to protect your home and your peace of mind.</p>



<span id="more-3081"></span>



<h2>Step 1: Shut Off the Water Supply</h2>



<p>First things first: locate the cold water shut-off valve on your water heater. It’s typically found above the unit. Turn it off to prevent more water from entering the tank and making the leak worse. If the valve is stuck or difficult to reach, you may need to shut off your home’s main water supply instead.</p>



<h2>Step 2: Turn Off the Power or Gas</h2>



<p>For electric water heaters, switch off the breaker labeled “water heater” in your electrical panel. If you have a gas model, turn the gas valve to the “off” position. This step is crucial for safety—leaks and electricity or gas don’t mix.</p>



<h2>Step 3: Identify the Source of the Leak</h2>



<p>Leaks can happen for a number of reasons. Some of the most common sources include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Loose drain valves</strong></li><li><strong>Corroded or cracked tank</strong></li><li><strong>A faulty temperature and pressure relief (T&amp;P) valve</strong></li><li><strong>Leaky plumbing connections</strong></li></ul>



<p>Carefully inspect the unit. If water is dripping from the top, it could be a fitting. If it’s pooling around the base, it may be the tank itself, especially if it’s over 10 years old.</p>



<h2>Step 4: Drain the Tank</h2>



<p>If the leak is significant or the tank is full, draining it can help prevent further water damage. Connect a garden hose to the drain valve at the bottom of the tank and run the hose outside or to a floor drain. Open the valve and allow the tank to empty.<br><br><strong>Important:</strong> Be cautious—water inside may still be hot. Let the unit cool before draining if needed.</p>



<h2>Step 5: Call a Professional</h2>



<p>Some minor leaks can be fixed with a quick repair, tightening a valve, or replacing a faulty part. But if the tank itself is corroded or cracked, replacement is likely the only safe and long-term solution. In many cases, calling a professional is the best route to ensure the issue is diagnosed and resolved correctly the first time.<br><br>That’s where we come in.

<p>A leaking water heater can be a frustrating—and potentially costly—problem. Whether you notice a small puddle near the base or water dripping from the tank itself, it’s a sign that something isn’t right. Left untreated, a water heater leak can lead to water damage, mold growth, and even complete system failure. In this post, we’ll walk you through the common causes of water heater leaks, how to diagnose the problem, and what steps you should take right away. If you&#8217;re experiencing issues with your hot water system, it&#8217;s time to call the experts in <a href="/plumbing/general-plumbing/water-heaters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water heater repair in Edmonton, AB.</a></p>



<span id="more-3030"></span>



<h2>Common Causes of a Leaking Water Heater</h2>



<h3>Loose Connections</h3>



<p>The most common source of leaks is a loose or faulty connection. Check the cold water inlet and hot water outlet pipes to make sure they are securely attached. Over time, fittings can corrode or loosen due to expansion and contraction, especially in older systems.</p>



<h3>Temperature &amp; Pressure Relief Valve (T&amp;P Valve)</h3>



<p>This valve is designed to release water if the tank’s pressure gets too high. If the valve is faulty or there’s excessive pressure, it may start leaking. Make sure the valve is not stuck open or clogged with sediment.</p>



<h3>Drain Valve Leaks</h3>



<p>Located near the bottom of the tank, the drain valve is used during maintenance to flush out sediment. If this valve is not tightly closed or has degraded over time, it can leak. A slow drip from the spout may mean it needs tightening or replacement.</p>



<h3>Internal Tank Corrosion</h3>



<p>If you notice water leaking from the bottom of the heater, internal corrosion could be the culprit. Over time, sediment builds up inside the tank and can corrode the lining, causing leaks. Unfortunately, once the tank is compromised, replacement is usually necessary.</p>



<h3>Condensation</h3>



<p>Sometimes, what looks like a leak is condensation, especially in colder climates like Edmonton. If your water heater is in a cool area and is working hard, moisture may form on the outside. This isn&#8217;t a sign of damage, but it can still create puddles and lead to confusion.</p>



<h2>What You Should Do Now</h2>



<h3>Turn Off the Power Supply</h3>



<p>For electric water heaters, shut off the power at the circuit breaker. If you have a gas model, switch the gas control valve to the &#8220;off&#8221; position.</p>



<h3>Shut Off the Water Supply</h3>



<p>Find the cold water shutoff valve (usually located at the top of the heater) and turn it off to prevent more water from entering the tank.</p>



<h3>Inspect the Source</h3>



<p>Use a flashlight to examine the unit. Check around valves, fittings, and the base of the tank. This will help you or your plumber quickly identify the issue.</p>



<h3>Call a Professional</h3>



<p>Unless the leak is due to something simple like condensation or a loose fitting, most water heater repairs are best left to professionals. Especially if the tank is damaged or old, trying to fix it yourself could make things worse. They have the tools and experience to fix the issue safely and prevent further damage.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.

<p>When it comes to upgrading your home’s water heating system, energy efficiency, cost savings, and convenience are likely top priorities. That’s why more homeowners are considering tankless water heaters as a modern solution. But is a tankless water heater right for your home? Let’s explore the pros, cons, and key considerations to help you decide.</p>



<span id="more-3007"></span>



<h2>What Is a Tankless Water Heater?</h2>



<p>Unlike traditional models that store hot water in a tank, tankless water heaters heat water on demand. That means you get hot water instantly—without waiting for a tank to fill up or reheat. These systems are compact, typically wall-mounted, and ideal for homeowners looking to save space and reduce energy bills.</p>



<h2>Benefits of Tankless Water Heaters</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Energy Efficiency: </strong>Tankless systems only heat water when needed, which can significantly reduce your energy consumption—especially in smaller households.</li><li><strong>Endless Hot Water: </strong>With a properly sized system, you’ll never run out of hot water during showers or while doing laundry and dishes at the same time.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Savings:</strong> Though the upfront cost may be higher, many homeowners see savings over time through lower utility bills and fewer repairs.</li><li><strong>Space-Saving Design: </strong>Without the need for a bulky tank, these systems are great for homes with limited utility space.</li><li><strong>Longer Lifespan:</strong> Tankless units often last up to 20 years, compared to 10–15 years for conventional heaters.</li></ul>



<h2>Things to Consider Before Switching</h2>



<p>While tankless water heaters offer many advantages, they’re not the perfect fit for every household.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Upfront Costs: </strong>Installation can be more expensive due to the need for upgraded gas lines or electrical work.</li><li><strong>Flow Rate Limits:</strong> If multiple taps or appliances are using hot water simultaneously, a single unit may struggle to keep up. You might need more than one system for larger homes.</li><li><strong>Maintenance Requirements:</strong> Hard water can cause buildup in tankless systems, so regular descaling may be necessary—especially in areas with mineral-rich water.</li></ul>



<h2>Is It Right for You?</h2>



<p>The best way to determine if a tankless water heater is right for your home is to consider your household size, water usage habits, and budget. If your family uses a moderate amount of hot water and you’re looking to reduce your carbon footprint, this could be an excellent upgrade.

Whether you’re building a new home or upgrading your current system, getting professional advice is crucial.<br><br><strong><a href="/contact/message.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">Contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.
