<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we care deeply about your family’s comfort and safety, especially when it comes to silent dangers like carbon monoxide (CO). This colorless, odorless gas can quickly become life-threatening if undetected. Fortunately, with a few proactive steps, you can dramatically reduce the risk of exposure in your home. Here are simple, effective ways to protect your family and improve peace of mind.</p>



<span id="more-3053"></span>



<h2>1. Install Carbon Monoxide Detectors</h2>



<p>The first and most critical step is installing carbon monoxide detectors on every level of your home, particularly near sleeping areas. These life-saving devices alert you if CO levels become unsafe. Make sure to test them monthly and replace batteries every six months. If your detectors are more than seven years old, it’s time to replace them.</p>



<h2>2. Schedule Regular Furnace Maintenance</h2>



<p>Gas furnaces can cause a carbon monoxide leak if they’re not maintained properly. Annual inspections and tune-ups by qualified technicians ensure your system runs safely and efficiently. Our licensed team at WeatherMakers specializes in servicing all makes and models, helping you avoid unexpected leaks and costly repairs.</p>



<h2>3. Never Use Outdoor Appliances Indoors</h2>



<p>It might seem obvious, but using outdoor devices like BBQs, generators, or propane heaters inside your home or garage—even for a short time—can cause dangerous CO buildup. Always use these appliances outdoors and far away from doors, windows, and vents.</p>



<h2>4. Ensure Proper Ventilation</h2>



<p>Blocked, cracked, or disconnected vents and chimneys can prevent carbon monoxide from escaping your home properly. If you’ve recently had renovations, a new appliance installed, or extreme weather conditions, it’s a good idea to inspect venting systems. Our professionals can help ensure everything is connected and functioning properly for maximum safety.</p>



<h2>5. Be Cautious With Fireplaces and Wood Stoves</h2>



<p>Fireplaces and wood-burning stoves can also produce carbon monoxide. Ensure your chimney is clean and free of debris. Always open the damper before lighting a fire, and never leave a fire unattended. Regular cleaning and inspection by a professional chimney sweep is essential.</p>



<h2>6. Improve Indoor Air Quality in Edmonton Homes</h2>



<p>Carbon monoxide is just one aspect of indoor safety. Enhancing your home’s ventilation, humidity control, and air purification can significantly improve overall<a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/indoor-air-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/indoor-air-quality"> indoor air quality in Edmonton.</a> Better air quality means fewer health risks, better comfort, and greater energy efficiency throughout the year.</p>



<h2>7. Know the Symptoms of CO Poisoning</h2>



<p>Fatigue, headaches, dizziness, nausea, and confusion can all be symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure. If multiple people in your home experience these symptoms at the same time, especially in winter, leave the house immediately and call 911. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>



<h2>Your Safety Is Our Priority</h2>



<p>At WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing, we’re not just your local HVAC experts—we’re your neighbors. We believe that every family deserves a safe, healthy home. Whether you need a CO detector installed, your furnace inspected, or your air quality assessed, we’re here to help.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dirty-ducts.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dirty-ducts-300x200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2916" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dirty-ducts-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dirty-ducts-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dirty-ducts-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dirty-ducts-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dirty-ducts.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Your ducts might never really get the attention they deserve. After all, why pay attention to air ducts when your heating system usually takes center stage as the unit that <em>actually</em> creates the heat you feel. And even when your ducts are clean, you don&#8217;t want to see them or be around them since they sit in dark corners and basements while you get to enjoy the beautiful rooms of your house.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s true that air ducts tend to get neglected. But luckily there&#8217;s an easy service you can sign up for that gets your air ducts cleaned and prepared for the next few years. We&#8217;re talking about <a href="/indoor-air-quality/duct-cleaning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">duct cleaning in Edmonton, AB.</a></p>



<p>When our experts provide duct cleaning, we root out any contaminants, mold infestations, caked-in dust, and dirt layers, and ensure your air ducts are not contributing to poor air quality or inefficiency. Let&#8217;s talk about why duct cleaning is just a good idea for the fall.</p>



<span id="more-2915"></span>



<h2>Why Duct Cleaning Is Important</h2>



<p>Air ducts are a vital part of your home comfort system. They help to transport the heated or cooled air from your centralized HVAC system to the rooms in your house. When you see vents everywhere, those vents are just the tail end of the ductwork system, they&#8217;re just one tiny part of a large network.</p>



<p>So, now that we know how important air ducts are, you can probably start to understand why their cleanliness is also important. If you&#8217;re having air transported through this network every day, then having that air get disrupted by dust, dirt, pet dander, and even pest droppings can cause immense problems for your health and efficiency.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible to tell what&#8217;s in your air ducts ahead of time since we don&#8217;t recommend customers open them up to look inside. But if you haven&#8217;t had your ducts cleaned in some time, then we recommend getting this work done as a routine courtesy so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it for a few years.</p>



<h3>&#8220;Can I Clean My Ducts on My Own?&#8221;</h3>



<p>This is not a good idea. We understand the enthusiastic sentiment of trying to get something done by yourself, and <strong>cleaning</strong> sounds like the easiest thing for a homeowner to do. But this is not normal cleaning.</p>



<p>This is akin to cleaning the inside of your car&#8217;s engine or the inside of your computer system. The components are extremely delicate and specific tools are required to clean them properly. Trying to do this without any training or expertise will lead you to the possibility of not getting the job done in its entirety or causing damage that needs repairs.</p>



<h2>This Lasts for a While</h2>



<p>Want to talk about the investment in duct cleaning? It might seem like it&#8217;s not worth it, but it lasts for a long time. Unless you live in very unique circumstances, our duct cleaning appointments are thorough and can last for years so you don&#8217;t have to think about it again for a long while.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a misconception going around that your heating system is the only thing that can help keep your home comfortable when temperatures suddenly drop. While this might sound like it&#8217;s true, there&#8217;s another system out there that can do an impressive job of keeping your home comfortable, healthy, and happy.</p>



<p>With such an unpredictable spring, we&#8217;re still expecting some frigid days ahead, so you&#8217;ll want to make sure your heating system is doing the best job it can. And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;d like to talk about how you can make a difference by coupling your furnace with a <a href="/indoor-air-quality/humidifiers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humidifier in Edmonton, AB.</a></p>



<p>That&#8217;s right! Humidifiers aren&#8217;t just for sleeping better and staying safe when an illness is going around. They&#8217;re actually incredibly good at easing the burden on your heating unit and allowing your home to stay more comfortable for longer. Let&#8217;s get into it down below.</p>



<span id="more-2846"></span>



<h2>What&#8217;s the Problem?</h2>



<p>When winter arrives, it carries with it <strong>cold </strong>and <strong>dry </strong>air. This is in stark contrast to the <strong>hot</strong> and <strong>humid</strong> air we get during the summer. Cold air is so dry that it can sometimes cause your skin to crack, your nose to dry up, and even give you issues with constant static shocks.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s a solution in the midst of all these problems. We&#8217;re talking about the humidifier!</p>



<p>A humidifier is a simple system. It takes a tank of water and turns it into water vapor, adding humidity in your air. This humidity keeps your body healthy and your home feeling more comfortable. But it has a hidden benefit as well, which isn&#8217;t mentioned very often.</p>



<h2>A Powerful Combination</h2>



<p>When a whole house humidifier is paired with a heating system like a furnace, you can get excellent temperature control. This is because <strong>humidity actually helps to hold heat in your air, </strong>allowing you to feel comfortable even when the temperature is the same as it would be without a humidifier.</p>



<p>Air that&#8217;s more humid is warmer for longer and gives your home a cozier feeling than air that&#8217;s dry. This is a major reason why we recommend customers invest in a humidifier.</p>



<p>Think about it this way&#8211;a humidifier will ease the burden on your furnace because it won&#8217;t have to run as many cycles in a day due to the humidity holding heat for longer. The efficiency difference might not be huge, but it&#8217;s noticeable on your bills.</p>



<h2>Additional Benefits of a Humidifier</h2>



<p>Humidifiers also come with a wide array of benefits, like <strong>better skin, better protection against illnesses, and more comfort. </strong>Humidity can also keep your antique furniture and old family heirlooms from cracking and breaking due to the dry, unforgiving air.</p>



<p>Humidifiers are some of the most popular systems that people purchase in our area, and they help make life comfortable in such a cold climate!</p>



<h2>Schedule an Installation Today</h2>



<p>Ready to have your home protected with a powerful layer of humidity? Then schedule a consultation with our team so we can measure the air in your home and set you up with a whole house humidifier that does the trick.</p>
