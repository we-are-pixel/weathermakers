<p>So, you’ve decided to get a new furnace—great choice! Whether your old system finally gave out or you’re upgrading to something more energy-efficient, knowing what to expect during a furnace installation can help make the process smooth and stress-free.</p>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step look at what happens when you install a new furnace in your home.</p>



<span id="more-2983"></span>



<h2>1. Pre-Installation Prep</h2>



<p>Before installation, a professional HVAC technician will typically visit your home for an assessment. This ensures that the new furnace is the right size for your space and meets your heating needs. The technician will also check your existing ductwork, ventilation, and electrical connections to make sure everything is in good shape.<br><br>It’s a good idea to clear the area around your furnace so the crew has plenty of space to work. If you have pets or kids, plan to keep them away from the work area for safety.</p>



<h2>2. Removing the Old Furnace</h2>



<p>On installation day, the first step is removing the old unit. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Shutting off the power and gas supply</li><li>Disconnecting the old furnace from the ductwork and vents</li><li>Safely removing and disposing of the old system</li></ul>



<p>This part of the process can take a few hours, depending on how accessible your furnace is and whether any additional modifications are needed.</p>



<h2>3. Installing the New Furnace</h2>



<p>Once the old system is out, the new furnace is carefully positioned and connected to your ductwork, gas line, and electrical system. The technician will ensure:</p>



<ul><li>Proper alignment with existing ductwork</li><li>Secure gas and electrical connections</li><li>Correct airflow and ventilation</li></ul>



<p>A <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces">furnace installation in Edmonton, AB</a> requires compliance with local building codes, so your technician will make sure everything meets safety and efficiency standards.</p>



<h2>4. System Testing &amp; Fine-Tuning</h2>



<p>Before wrapping up, the HVAC team will test the system to ensure everything is working correctly. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>Checking for gas leaks</li><li>Testing airflow and temperature output</li><li>Verifying that the thermostat is properly connected and calibrated</li></ul>



<p>They’ll also walk you through how to use your new system, including any maintenance tips to keep it running efficiently.</p>



<h2>5. Post-Installation Cleanup &amp; Final Walkthrough</h2>



<p>A professional team won’t leave a mess behind. Expect them to clean up their work area and remove any debris from the installation. Before they go, they’ll answer any last-minute questions and make sure you’re comfortable with your new furnace.</p>



<h2>Enjoy Your Warm &amp; Cozy Home!</h2>



<p>A properly installed furnace can make all the difference in keeping your home warm and your energy bills in check. Be sure to schedule regular maintenance to keep it running efficiently for years to come.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full"><a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/th.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="302" height="200" src="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/th.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2964" srcset="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/th.jpg 302w, https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/th-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 302px) 100vw, 302px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Boilers are the heart of your home’s heating system, working tirelessly to keep you warm and comfortable during the colder months. But like any hardworking system, boilers require regular maintenance and occasional repairs to perform their best. Ignoring potential issues can lead to costly breakdowns or, worse, complete system failure. If you suspect your boiler might need attention, here’s how to spot the signs you need boiler repair before it’s too late.</p>



<span id="more-2953"></span>



<h3>1. Inconsistent Heating</h3>



<p>One of the most obvious signs of a boiler problem is uneven heating throughout your home. If certain rooms feel colder than others or your radiator isn’t warming up as it should, your boiler could be struggling. This may indicate issues such as a failing pump, air trapped in the system, or thermostat malfunctions.</p>



<h3>2. Strange Noises</h3>



<p>Boilers aren’t meant to be noisy. If you hear banging, whistling, or gurgling sounds, it could be due to a variety of problems, such as low water pressure, a buildup of limescale, or even a faulty heat exchanger. These sounds shouldn’t be ignored, as they could worsen over time and lead to a system breakdown.</p>



<h3>3. Rising Energy Bills</h3>



<p>If your energy bills have skyrocketed without an increase in usage, your boiler might be operating inefficiently. This inefficiency could stem from worn-out components, poor system calibration, or sediment buildup, all of which can force your boiler to work harder than necessary.</p>



<h3>4. Unusual Smells</h3>



<p>A well-functioning boiler should never emit strange odors. If you notice a burning smell, it could mean overheating components. If you detect a metallic or sulfur-like odor, it might indicate a gas leak or an issue with the fuel supply. In such cases, you should turn off your boiler immediately and seek professional assistance.</p>



<h3>5. Leaking or Dripping Water</h3>



<p>Water pooling around your boiler is never a good sign. Leaks can result from faulty seals, broken pressure valves, or corroded pipes. Not only can leaks cause water damage, but they can also indicate a significant underlying problem with your system.</p>



<h3>6. Pilot Light Problems</h3>



<p>The pilot light is crucial for a boiler to function correctly. If it keeps going out or burns yellow instead of blue, it may indicate an issue with the gas supply or a carbon monoxide leak. Either issue requires immediate attention from a qualified technician.</p>



<h4>Why Professional Boiler Repair Matters</h4>



<p class="has-text-align-left">If you’re experiencing any of these issues, it’s essential to call a professional for <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/boilers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/boilers">boiler repair in Edmonton, AB.</a> Expert technicians can diagnose and fix problems quickly, ensuring your system operates efficiently and safely. Regular maintenance and timely repairs can also extend the life of your boiler, saving you money in the long run.<br><br>Don’t let boiler problems leave you out in the cold. <br></p>

<p>Winter in Canada can be brutal, with temperatures plummeting well below freezing and snow piling up for months. During these frigid months, your home’s furnace becomes your best friend, keeping you warm and safe from the bitter cold.</p>



<p>However, to ensure your furnace operates efficiently and reliably throughout the season, regular maintenance is essential. Here are the top benefits of <a href="/heating/furnaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">furnace maintenance in Edmonton, AB</a> during an especially harsh winter.</p>



<span id="more-2937"></span>



<h3>1. <strong>Enhanced Energy Efficiency</strong></h3>



<p>A well-maintained furnace runs more efficiently, consuming less energy to heat your home. During a harsh winter, when your furnace is running almost constantly, even small improvements in efficiency can lead to significant savings on your energy bills. Cleaning and tuning up the furnace ensures that components like the blower motor, burners, and heat exchanger are working optimally.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>Improved Reliability</strong></h3>



<p>Few things are as stressful as a furnace breakdown in the middle of a freezing night. Regular maintenance helps identify and address potential issues before they escalate into major problems. By scheduling a professional inspection and tune-up before the winter sets in, you can enjoy peace of mind knowing your furnace is less likely to fail when you need it most.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Better Indoor Air Quality</strong></h3>



<p>During the winter, Canadians spend the majority of their time indoors, making indoor air quality crucial. A dirty or poorly maintained furnace can circulate dust, allergens, and even harmful gases like carbon monoxide. Replacing the air filter, cleaning ducts, and inspecting the system during maintenance will help keep your indoor air clean and healthy for your family.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Extended Lifespan of Your Furnace</strong></h3>



<p>Furnaces are a significant investment, and you want yours to last as long as possible. Regular maintenance reduces wear and tear on critical components, helping to extend the lifespan of your system. A well-maintained furnace can last 15-20 years or more, while neglect can lead to costly premature replacements.</p>



<h3>5. <strong>Safety Assurance</strong></h3>



<p>Safety is especially important during a harsh Canadian winter, as heating equipment is running at full capacity for extended periods. Maintenance checks ensure that your furnace is operating safely. Technicians will inspect for gas leaks, faulty connections, or issues with the heat exchanger that could pose a fire or carbon monoxide risk.</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Consistent Comfort</strong></h3>



<p>A poorly maintained furnace may struggle to maintain a consistent temperature throughout your home, leaving some rooms too cold and others too warm. Maintenance ensures your system distributes heat evenly, keeping every corner of your home comfortable, no matter how low the temperatures drop outside.</p>



<h3>7. <strong>Cost Savings in the Long Run</strong></h3>



<p>While maintenance has an upfront cost, it can save you money in the long run. Efficient operation lowers energy bills, early problem detection prevents expensive repairs, and an extended lifespan reduces the need for premature replacement. It’s an investment that pays for itself over time.</p>



<p>A reliable furnace is the cornerstone of comfort during a Canadian winter. By investing in regular maintenance, you ensure your system’s efficiency, reliability, and safety, keeping your home warm and cozy no matter how harsh the weather gets. Don’t wait until it’s too late—schedule your furnace maintenance today and enjoy the benefits all winter long.</p>

<p><strong>Which heating system is right for you?</strong> This is a question that many homeowners are beginning to ask as they see an opportunity to invest in a new, energy-efficient heating unit that makes serious improvements in their home comfort.</p>



<p>With several options on the market, homeowners can choose the best solution based on their energy needs, comfort preferences, and budget. Three popular systems are gas furnaces, central heat pumps, and ductless mini-splits. Here’s a detailed look at each to help you decide which <a href="/heating/heating-installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heating system installation in Edmonton, AB</a> might be the best.</p>



<span id="more-2920"></span>



<h3>Gas Furnaces</h3>



<p>Gas furnaces are one of the most common heating systems in Edmonton. They operate by burning natural gas to produce heat, which is then distributed throughout the home via ductwork.</p>



<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Gas furnaces are known for their powerful and consistent heat output, which is essential in extremely cold climates. They also tend to be cost-effective over time, especially with Edmonton’s access to affordable natural gas. Modern high-efficiency gas furnaces can achieve efficiencies of up to 98%, which translates to lower energy bills and reduced environmental impact. Additionally, they have long lifespans, lasting 10-15 years with proper maintenance.</p>



<p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Despite their efficiency, gas furnaces require ductwork, so they may not be the best option for homes without an existing duct system. They also require regular maintenance to ensure safe operation and prevent issues like gas leaks or carbon monoxide exposure. Initial installation costs can be higher, particularly if you need to install ducts.</p>



<h3>Central Heat Pumps</h3>



<p>Central heat pumps are versatile systems that can both heat and cool your home. They work by transferring heat rather than generating it, drawing warmth from the air (even in cold temperatures), and moving it into the home. In the summer, they reverse the process to provide cooling.</p>



<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Central heat pumps are highly energy-efficient, as they move heat instead of creating it. This energy-saving technology can lead to lower utility bills, especially during milder seasons when heating demand is lower. Newer heat pumps are now more efficient in subzero temperatures, making them a viable option for Edmonton’s chilly climate. Their dual functionality (heating and cooling) also makes them a convenient, year-round solution.</p>



<p><strong>Considerations:</strong> While heat pumps can work in low temperatures, they often need a supplementary heat source (like a gas furnace) for extremely cold days, which could increase upfront costs. In Edmonton, choosing a cold-climate heat pump model designed for northern regions is essential to ensure effective heating in winter.</p>



<h3>Ductless Mini-Splits</h3>



<p>Ductless mini-split heat pumps consist of an outdoor unit and one or more indoor units that deliver warm or cool air directly into rooms. They don’t require ducts, making them a popular choice for homes without central air systems.</p>



<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Ductless mini-splits provide zoned heating, allowing you to control temperatures in different areas of your home. This leads to energy savings, as you’re not heating unoccupied rooms. Mini-splits are highly efficient and work well in moderately cold temperatures, making them a great option for the milder parts of the Edmonton heating season. Installation is straightforward, with minimal structural impact, and they offer both heating and cooling.</p>



<p><strong>Considerations:</strong> While they’re efficient, ductless mini-splits may struggle to provide sufficient heat during extreme cold snaps without assistance from a secondary heating source. Additionally, multiple indoor units may be needed to fully heat larger homes, which can raise the initial cost.</p>

<span id="more-2704"></span>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Heat pumps have gained popularity in recent years due to several reasons:</strong></h3>



<ol><li><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Heat pumps are highly energy-efficient heating and cooling systems. They can extract heat from the outdoor air and transfer it to indoor spaces for heating purposes. Compared to traditional heating systems like furnaces or electric resistance heaters, heat pumps can provide heat in the shoulder seasons with significantly less energy consumption. This efficiency translates to lower energy bills and reduced environmental impact.</li><li><strong>Renewable energy integration:</strong> Heat pumps can be combined with renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines. By using electricity generated from renewable sources, heat pumps can provide heating and cooling while minimizing reliance on fossil fuels. This aligns with the growing emphasis on sustainability and reducing carbon emissions.</li><li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Heat pumps offer both heating and cooling capabilities. They can be used for space heating during cooler months and reverse the cycle to provide cooling during warmer months. This dual functionality reduces the time four gas furnace runs during the heating season, saving you money and protecting the environment.</li><li><strong>Government incentives and policies:</strong> Many governments around the world have implemented incentives and policies to promote the adoption of heat pumps. These can include tax credits, rebates, grants, or favorable financing options. Such initiatives aim to encourage the use of energy-efficient technologies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li><li><strong>Technological advancements:</strong> Advancements in heat pump technology have improved their efficiency, performance, and reliability. Innovations like variable-speed compressors, smart controls, and improved refrigerants have contributed to better energy savings and enhanced user experience. As these technologies continue to evolve, heat pumps become more attractive to consumers.</li><li><strong>Increasing environmental awareness:</strong> There is a growing global awareness about climate change and the need to transition to more sustainable practices. Heat pumps, with their ability to reduce carbon footprint and dependence on fossil fuels, align with this environmental consciousness. As a result, more individuals and organizations are opting for heat pump systems as part of their efforts to contribute to a greener future.</li></ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy integration, versatility, government incentives, technological advancements, and environmental considerations has propelled the popularity of heat pumps in recent years.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Tips, Tricks and Humidifier Know-how</h2>



<p>If your home is warmed by a forced-air furnace, you will want to invest in a humidifier (or two). Why? Dry winter air is hard on homes, hard on pets and plants, and most importantly, hard on people. <a href="/indoor-air-quality/humidifiers">Add a little humidity and you’ll bring added comfort to your home</a> this winter.</p>



<p>Many notice their skin, hands and scalp get drier in winter. Along with that can come sore throats, aggravated asthma symptoms, dust allergies, and even nosebleeds for some. Homeowners have many humidification options available to them, so let’s discuss the common ones to see what scenario might be right for your home and lifestyle.</p>



<span id="more-1219"></span>



<h3>Furnace Humidifiers</h3>



<p>Furnace humidifiers work in conjunction with your furnace. They are often bread-box-sized units that attach to your furnace. As air is blown through the humidifier, it picks up humidity, which is carried through your ductwork to the different rooms of your home. These humidifiers typically require a small plastic waterline in to deliver water and a larger drain hose out. Installation can be a DIY project depending on your skills or a quick and easy job performed by a professional.</p>



<p>The pros of a furnace humidifier are that it delivers moist air throughout the whole house; it only runs when your furnace runs, saving energy when compared to a humidifier that runs 24/7; and it saves table and counter space as it’s in the basement. Another plus is that moist air feels warmer in winter, so you might be able to keep the thermostat lower than if you didn’t humidify. For those who don’t want to lug water every day, these fit the bill as they don’t require filling.</p>



<h3>Types of Furnace Humidifiers</h3>



<p><strong>Steam humidifers:</strong> produce either a warm or cool mist and require a small amount of electricity. Their main advantage is that they won’t cause mold.</p>



<p><strong>Flow through humidifiers:</strong> expose warm furnace air to water, which evaporates and humidifies the air. These units have filters that need to be cleaned or replaced regularly. There is little chance of mold.</p>



<p><strong>Drum humidifiers:</strong> have a rotating filter that sits in a pan of water. This type requires regular cleaning and maintenance or else scale could stop the drum from turning and mold can grow in the pan. Its advantage is that it’s affordable and easy to install on virtually any furnace.</p>



<p>Not sure which type to get? <a href="/contact/message">Call WeatherMakers</a>, and we’ll send out a certified technician to assess your home and suggest the best options for you to consider.</p>



<h3>Stand-Alone Humidifiers</h3>



<p>These humidifiers occupy the main living spaces of your home. They can be large floor-based units, or smaller vaporizers that sit on your nightstand. Their advantages are that they are portable, easy to use and fairly affordable.</p>



<p><strong>Steam vaporizers:</strong> you remember this one from childhood. It hissed a visible plume of steam into your bedroom, and sometimes your parents added cold medicine to it. Tried and true, but best used around adults as the steam is hot.</p>



<p><strong>Mist humidifiers:</strong> operate on the same principle as the vaporizer but emit cool or warm mist only. They’re safe to use around children.</p>



<p><strong>Impeller types:</strong> spray water at a screen that breaks the water into a fine mist. Evaporative types use a wick (filter, sheet) soaked with water to gently humidify the air. Ultrasonic humidifiers also fall into this category.</p>



<p><strong>Console Humidifiers:</strong> these are large units that can humidify an entire house&#8211;some units reach up to 4,500 square feet. They are loud, require a lot of water and work very well in homes built on one or two levels. Some can be installed to work along with your furnace.</p>



<p><strong>Combo Units:</strong> a humidifier puts moisture in the air, and a purifier takes out the pollutants and odours. Some brands combine the two, but unless you buy top units, they might not work as well as you hope.</p>



<h3>What’s the Right Humidity Level for Your Home?</h3>



<p>Wood floors and furniture benefit from a humidity level of at least 35% to prevent splitting along the grain. People tend to benefit from humidity levels between 35% and 45%. Anything higher and you risk mold and condensation on windows and window sashes when temperatures drop as cold air can’t hold as much water as warm air.</p>



<p>If you suspect your home is too humid, <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">call an HVAC technician</a> who will bring a hygrometer to accurately measure the humidity in your home. If you suspect mold in your ductwork, a <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/indoor-air-quality/uv-germicidal-lights">UV purification system</a> will help eliminate the problem. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/indoor-air-quality/duct-cleaning">Cleaning your ductwork</a> can help as well.</p>



<h4>Signs Your Air Is Too Dry</h4>



<ul><li>Static electricity</li><li>Droopy plants</li><li>Chapped lips</li><li>Splitting wood on furniture, floors, musical instruments and cooking utensils</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Dry skin</li></ul>



<h3>DIY Home Humidification Tricks</h3>



<ul><li>Bunch houseplants in living spaces&#8211;they’ll release water into the air</li><li>Hang your clothes to dry and they’ll release water into the air</li><li>Shower with the door open</li><li>Set water jugs or vases in the sun to evaporate the water</li><li>Boil water on the stove while cooking dinner</li></ul><p>The post <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/heating-service/how-to-humidify-your-home-in-winter/">How to Humidify Your Home in Winter</a> first appeared on <a href="https://www.weathermakerscomfort.com/blog">WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling & Plumbing</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the chores that sits atop every homeowner’s To-Do List is “Change Furnace Filter.” If you’re a new homeowner or new to a home with a forced-air furnace, you might not know how to change the filter, and most likely, you don’t see why you have to do it so often. Without a doubt, furnace filters need to be replaced regularly&#8211;monthly to every couple months&#8211;depending on the furnace you have and the type of filter you prefer. Changing your filter will keep your furnace running at peak efficiency and will help keep excess dust and pollutants from entering your home.</p>



<p>Follow these steps, and you’ll keep your furnace happy all season long. Not sure you’re comfy going under the hood of your furnace? <a href="/heating/furnaces">Learn more about furnaces here.</a></p>



<span id="more-1217"></span>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Furnace Filter Replacement</h3>



<p>Discover what type of filter fits your furnace. Some filters are seated into a small metal slot at the side of the furnace, while others are located behind metal screens or under panels. It’s always best to turn your furnace off before reaching into a furnace or removing a filter. You can do this at your thermostat by turning the “Heat” setting off or by turning the furnace off at the source via a switch that should be marked as “On” or “Off.”</p>



<p>Once the unit is off, remove the existing filter carefully, ensuring no filter materials remain. Look for an arrow on the filter indicating airflow direction. Using a permanent marker, draw the airflow direction on the outside of the furnace, so you&#8217;ll always know the right way to install the filter. You want to help air flow, not impede it, so pay special attention to this part. Then note the furnace filter size, which will be printed on the cardboard frame.</p>



<p>Note: A filter that has a plastic frame is a reusable filter, and you can clean it regularly using a vacuum or water. Just be sure to let it dry out completely before reinstalling. This can be a pain during the cold months, so consider keeping a spare reusable filter or vacuuming monthly and washing seasonally.</p>



<p>Replace the existing filter, turn on your furnace and go shopping!</p>



<h3>Step 2</h3>



<p>Buy the same filter or the same sized filter at your local home centre or hardware store. Feel free to choose a disposable or reusable model&#8211;both work just fine. Note that buying disposable furnace filters in bulk often saves money over buying them individually. As well, if you choose more affordable filters, just be sure to change them regularly and take extra care installing and removing them&#8211;they can be rather flimsy.</p>



<h3>Step 3</h3>



<p>Install the new filter so the arrow points the same way as it did on the filter that you removed. It should fit snuggly but not too snuggly. If something looks wrong, take a picture and consult a furnace technician or your furnace aisle pro at your hardware store. Once you’re certain you have the right filter in the right place facing the right way, replace any panels or covers. We recommend you place a note in your calendar reminding you when to perform your next furnace filter maintenance.</p>



<p>This one little chore done regularly can save you money and keep your furnace in top condition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Keep Your Spaces Safe and Warm This Winter</h2>



<p>In Alberta, we have many spaces that we heat—from our homes to our cabins to our garages and fishing shacks. We’re pretty clever about finding sources of heat in -30 Celsius. So, here’s a quick guide to popular direct heat sources, how to use them safely, and how to determine what’s cost-effective and what’s just plain costly.</p>



<span id="more-1208"></span>



<h3>Fireplaces</h3>



<p>Albertans love their fireplaces! Gas (and most wood) fireplaces are basically part of every home’s décor, but it needs to be said that they’re not always an effective heat source. An open fireplace will generally lose more heat than it provides, because so much warm air is drawn through the unit and must be replaced by cold outside air. On the other hand, if the fireplace has a tight-sealing glass door, a source of outside air, and a good chimney damper, it can provide useful heat.</p>



<p>Air quality with an open fireplace will be an issue. No matter what, combustion products will enter your home’s environment. If this pollution is a problem, have a look at sealed wood pellet stoves. They are much more efficient, heat better and greatly reduce air pollutants emitted inside and outside of the home.</p>



<h3>Gas-Fired Space Heaters</h3>



<p>In small spaces, outbuildings, garages, and some additions, gas-fired space heaters are used to provide warmth&#8211;typically whenever there’s a break between a larger, conventionally heated space and the smaller space. This category of heater includes wall-mounted, free-standing, and floor furnaces, all characterized by their lack of ductwork and relatively small heat output. Because they lack ducts, they are most useful for warming a single room. If heat is required for several rooms, either the doors between rooms must be left open or another heating method is necessary.</p>



<p>Consider these as add-on heating solutions, and keep in mind that better models use “sealed combustion air” systems, with pipes installed through the wall to bring combustion air in and vent combustion products away.</p>



<p>These units can provide acceptable performance, particularly for cabins and other buildings where large temperature differences between bedrooms and main rooms are acceptable. The models can be fired with natural gas or propane, and some burn kerosene.</p>



<h3>Unvented Gas-Fired Heaters: Never A Safe Option</h3>



<p>Unvented gas or kerosene space heaters have been sold for decades, and we see them often in garages, outbuildings and fishing shacks, but we shouldn’t. They are dangerous. These include wall-mounted and free-standing heaters as well as open-flame gas fireplaces with ceramic logs. Rule of thumb, if there’s no chimney, you’re breathing combustion products and your space could become oxygen depleted very quickly unless there’s a good source of fresh air.</p>



<h3>Electric Space Heaters</h3>



<p>Portable electric heaters are affordable to purchase, but they can become costly if you run them all the time. Why? Well, it’s in the name. Resistive heaters include oil-filled and “infrared” heaters. They convert electricity to heat by squeezing current through elements, much like your toaster, for example. It takes a lot of electricity to deliver a decent amount of useful heat. Plus, these heaters can use almost the entire capacity of a 15-amp branch circuit. Add another plug, and your breaker flips.</p>



<p>Use these heaters intermittently and ensure the heater is far from flammable items and your electrical is up to code.</p>



<h3>Wood-Burning and Pellet Stoves</h3>



<p>Wood-burning heat is pleasurable and just makes sense in cabins and rural settings. If it’s a wood pellet stove, just keep an extra bag of pellets handy. No muss, no fuss. If it’s a log burner, be sure you like to split, stack and stoke, as we say, and you’ll be just fine. Wood prices are generally pretty affordable, and if you cut your own wood, then fuel is close to free.</p>



<p>It used to be that we shied away from wood-burning stoves to heat cabins and outbuildings because of rising global pollution. Nowadays, wood stoves are quite efficient and clean burning. Pellet stoves are even better than wood stoves for this and offer users greater convenience, temperature control, and indoor air quality.</p>



<p>No matter what option you choose, be sure to use it safely and soundly. If you have a building that’s in need of more permanent and reliable heating, <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message">contact WeatherMakers today.</a> We’ll assess your space and give you an estimate for the options we find. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WeatherMakers furnace technicians say they face one tough question on a regular basis when they’re out on their service calls: “Should I continue to repair my furnace, or should I just replace it?” When it’s obvious, the answer is simple, but when a furnace is on the fence, it’s a hard question to answer. We’ve pulled together some information from our experience that we hope will help you as a homeowner decide when to repair vs. replace your furnace, and more importantly, feel good about your decision.</p>



<span id="more-1206"></span>



<h2>When Should You Repair Your Furnace?</h2>



<p>To answer this question, we need to consider your unit and its history. The first question we will ask you is whether or not you’ve been investing in annual maintenance. If so, and the furnace is less than 10 years old, there’s a good chance that we’re in fix-it territory. The reason is this, annual maintenance ensures that your furnace runs efficiently and problem-free. If it’s under 10 and hasn’t suffered any abuse or shutdowns, it’s likely still in good shape.</p>



<p>That said, if you’ve been ignoring your furnace, and after 6-8 years it’s finally given up, well, the cost to fix all the issues could be on the high side. What we do then is take a look at all that’s wrong and cost it out. If repairs = replacement, it might be a wiser choice to upgrade to a newer, more efficient furnace. Honestly, in this case, it’s all in the math, and we’ll give you an upfront, transparent estimate of work so you can make your best decision.</p>



<p>Now, to get back to those tricky on-the-fence furnaces. In short, we take into consideration frequency of repairs, cost of repairs per year, and age of the unit. As age and repair costs go up, in particular, so should your impetus to replace the furnace. If you’re calling us more than twice a year, your repair costs are over $500, and your furnace is older than 10 years, let’s think about replacing the unit. Take a look at the questions below and see how often you answer yes.</p>



<h3>Furnace Analysis Questions</h3>



<ol><li><strong>Is My Furnace 10 Years or Older?</strong><br>Most furnaces last 10-16 years. Once a furnace is 10 or more years old, it’s on the decline. Regular maintenance will help you win more years from it, but in general, your furnace owes you nothing after the age of 12. To check the age of your furnace, simply look at the installation label – it will have the date of installation and the date it was manufactured. If you’re having trouble finding it, write down the serial number and get in touch with us or the manufacturer.</li><li><strong>Does My Furnace Require Frequent Service Calls?</strong><br>Annual maintenance is not a service call, but a conked-out furnace is, and so is a call to fix a squeak, low heat, or continual running. Are you calling us every few months because your furnace isn’t working properly? Constant repairs add up, so talk to one of our technicians and [get a professional furnace evaluation and inspection]. A new furnace may be the solution to staying safe and keeping your overall costs down.</li><li><strong>Are My Energy Bills Rising?</strong><br>Furnaces lose efficiency as they age, especially if they haven’t been getting annual maintenance. At some point, your old furnace will cost more to run than a new, more efficient furnace. We can help you make that evaluation by providing you the cost to buy, install and run a new unit, and you can compare that to your costs to run the old furnace.</li><li><strong>What’s the Quality of the Furnace Air?</strong><br>Is your home stuffy, dusty and dry? It’s likely that the humidification and filtration attached to your older furnace is shot. Don’t discount creature comforts, there are excellent new filtration and humidification products on the market, and investing in them and a new furnace could change your quality of life for the better.</li></ol>
