<p>Every single furnace has an air filter&#8211;or at least every <em>working</em> furnace has an air filter. This component is very important because it protects sensitive interior systems like wires, burners, and the heat exchanger from getting caked in dust and debris. The air filter isn&#8217;t designed to improve your air quality, but it can also do that as long as you do one simple task:</p>



<p><strong>Remember to change it every 1-3 months.</strong></p>



<p>This blog post is going to focus on the importance of a furnace&#8217;s air filter and how it works to generally keep the components of your system safe and efficient. The longer you go without replacing the air filter, the more likely it is that you&#8217;ll see a rise in heating bills and poor comfort throughout your home.</p>



<p>Do you still need to call us for <a href="/heating/furnaces.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">furnace repairs in Edmonton, AB</a> if something goes wrong? Of course! But if there&#8217;s nothing wrong right now, you might be able to stave off those future repairs by replacing the filter.</p>



<span id="more-2924"></span>



<h2>Why Air Filter Maintenance Matters</h2>



<p>The air filter in your furnace is designed to trap dust, debris, and other airborne particles before they circulate through your home. Over time, the filter becomes clogged with these contaminants, restricting airflow. This forces your furnace to work harder to push air through, which not only wastes energy but also reduces the system’s overall performance. A clean air filter ensures your furnace operates efficiently, saving you money on energy bills and extending the life of the system.</p>



<h2>Benefits During the Holiday Season</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Improved Indoor Air Quality</strong>. The holidays often mean more people in your home, which can stir up additional dust, allergens, and even germs. A clean air filter helps remove these particles from the air, creating a healthier environment for your family and guests. This is especially important if anyone in your home suffers from allergies or asthma.</li><li><strong>Reliable Heating for Guests</strong>. A clogged filter can lead to furnace malfunctions, which are the last thing you want during a holiday gathering. Replacing the filter reduces the risk of breakdowns, ensuring your home stays warm and welcoming for guests.</li><li><strong>Lower Energy Bills During a High-Usage Season</strong>. With the furnace running more frequently during colder months, an inefficient system can significantly drive up energy costs. A clean filter allows your furnace to heat your home more effectively, reducing energy consumption and keeping your utility bills in check.</li></ul>



<h2>How to Change Your Air Filter</h2>



<p>Replacing an air filter is a quick and easy task. Start by turning off the furnace, locating the filter compartment, and removing the old filter. Check your furnace manual for the correct size and type of replacement filter. Once the new filter is in place, turn the system back on and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a well-maintained furnace.</p>



<p>A little maintenance now can go a long way toward ensuring a warm, comfortable, and stress-free holiday season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the chores that sits atop every homeowner’s To-Do List is “Change Furnace Filter.” If you’re a new homeowner or new to a home with a forced-air furnace, you might not know how to change the filter, and most likely, you don’t see why you have to do it so often. Without a doubt, furnace filters need to be replaced regularly&#8211;monthly to every couple months&#8211;depending on the furnace you have and the type of filter you prefer. Changing your filter will keep your furnace running at peak efficiency and will help keep excess dust and pollutants from entering your home.</p>



<p>Follow these steps, and you’ll keep your furnace happy all season long. Not sure you’re comfy going under the hood of your furnace? <a href="/heating/furnaces.html">Learn more about furnaces here.</a></p>



<span id="more-1217"></span>



<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Furnace Filter Replacement</h3>



<p>Discover what type of filter fits your furnace. Some filters are seated into a small metal slot at the side of the furnace, while others are located behind metal screens or under panels. It’s always best to turn your furnace off before reaching into a furnace or removing a filter. You can do this at your thermostat by turning the “Heat” setting off or by turning the furnace off at the source via a switch that should be marked as “On” or “Off.”</p>



<p>Once the unit is off, remove the existing filter carefully, ensuring no filter materials remain. Look for an arrow on the filter indicating airflow direction. Using a permanent marker, draw the airflow direction on the outside of the furnace, so you&#8217;ll always know the right way to install the filter. You want to help air flow, not impede it, so pay special attention to this part. Then note the furnace filter size, which will be printed on the cardboard frame.</p>



<p>Note: A filter that has a plastic frame is a reusable filter, and you can clean it regularly using a vacuum or water. Just be sure to let it dry out completely before reinstalling. This can be a pain during the cold months, so consider keeping a spare reusable filter or vacuuming monthly and washing seasonally.</p>



<p>Replace the existing filter, turn on your furnace and go shopping!</p>



<h3>Step 2</h3>



<p>Buy the same filter or the same sized filter at your local home centre or hardware store. Feel free to choose a disposable or reusable model&#8211;both work just fine. Note that buying disposable furnace filters in bulk often saves money over buying them individually. As well, if you choose more affordable filters, just be sure to change them regularly and take extra care installing and removing them&#8211;they can be rather flimsy.</p>



<h3>Step 3</h3>



<p>Install the new filter so the arrow points the same way as it did on the filter that you removed. It should fit snuggly but not too snuggly. If something looks wrong, take a picture and consult a furnace technician or your furnace aisle pro at your hardware store. Once you’re certain you have the right filter in the right place facing the right way, replace any panels or covers. We recommend you place a note in your calendar reminding you when to perform your next furnace filter maintenance.</p>



<p>This one little chore done regularly can save you money and keep your furnace in top condition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WeatherMakers furnace technicians say they face one tough question on a regular basis when they’re out on their service calls: “Should I continue to repair my furnace, or should I just replace it?” When it’s obvious, the answer is simple, but when a furnace is on the fence, it’s a hard question to answer. We’ve pulled together some information from our experience that we hope will help you as a homeowner decide when to repair vs. replace your furnace, and more importantly, feel good about your decision.</p>



<span id="more-1206"></span>



<h2>When Should You Repair Your Furnace?</h2>



<p>To answer this question, we need to consider your unit and its history. The first question we will ask you is whether or not you’ve been investing in annual maintenance. If so, and the furnace is less than 10 years old, there’s a good chance that we’re in fix-it territory. The reason is this, annual maintenance ensures that your furnace runs efficiently and problem-free. If it’s under 10 and hasn’t suffered any abuse or shutdowns, it’s likely still in good shape.</p>



<p>That said, if you’ve been ignoring your furnace, and after 6-8 years it’s finally given up, well, the cost to fix all the issues could be on the high side. What we do then is take a look at all that’s wrong and cost it out. If repairs = replacement, it might be a wiser choice to upgrade to a newer, more efficient furnace. Honestly, in this case, it’s all in the math, and we’ll give you an upfront, transparent estimate of work so you can make your best decision.</p>



<p>Now, to get back to those tricky on-the-fence furnaces. In short, we take into consideration frequency of repairs, cost of repairs per year, and age of the unit. As age and repair costs go up, in particular, so should your impetus to replace the furnace. If you’re calling us more than twice a year, your repair costs are over $500, and your furnace is older than 10 years, let’s think about replacing the unit. Take a look at the questions below and see how often you answer yes.</p>



<h3>Furnace Analysis Questions</h3>



<ol><li><strong>Is My Furnace 10 Years or Older?</strong><br>Most furnaces last 10-16 years. Once a furnace is 10 or more years old, it’s on the decline. Regular maintenance will help you win more years from it, but in general, your furnace owes you nothing after the age of 12. To check the age of your furnace, simply look at the installation label – it will have the date of installation and the date it was manufactured. If you’re having trouble finding it, write down the serial number and get in touch with us or the manufacturer.</li><li><strong>Does My Furnace Require Frequent Service Calls?</strong><br>Annual maintenance is not a service call, but a conked-out furnace is, and so is a call to fix a squeak, low heat, or continual running. Are you calling us every few months because your furnace isn’t working properly? Constant repairs add up, so talk to one of our technicians and [get a professional furnace evaluation and inspection]. A new furnace may be the solution to staying safe and keeping your overall costs down.</li><li><strong>Are My Energy Bills Rising?</strong><br>Furnaces lose efficiency as they age, especially if they haven’t been getting annual maintenance. At some point, your old furnace will cost more to run than a new, more efficient furnace. We can help you make that evaluation by providing you the cost to buy, install and run a new unit, and you can compare that to your costs to run the old furnace.</li><li><strong>What’s the Quality of the Furnace Air?</strong><br>Is your home stuffy, dusty and dry? It’s likely that the humidification and filtration attached to your older furnace is shot. Don’t discount creature comforts, there are excellent new filtration and humidification products on the market, and investing in them and a new furnace could change your quality of life for the better.</li></ol>



<h3>Options for Affordability</h3>



<p>Many people put off getting a new furnace as long as possible because it’s just too expensive for their budget at the time. But it doesn’t have to be. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/about/financing.html">WeatherMakers offers financing options</a>, and in some situations, there are rebates in place to help bring costs down. If you need help deciding whether to repair or replace your furnace, <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message.html">call WeatherMakers today</a>. Our experienced technicians will do a thorough inspection and give you recommendations based on their findings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What Do Furnace Odours Indicate?</h2>



<p>You know that smell the first time your home furnace fires up&#8211;a little bit dusty, a little bit … unnerving? Honestly, that hot dust smell upon first fire-up is OK&#8211;nothing to be worried about if it goes away. Your fan has been sitting idle for a couple weeks to a couple months and some dust has settled in the works. It’ll blow clear and diminish in minutes. It’s the other smells that you want to use as an early warning sign that your furnace needs an adjustment or repair. Sniff something weird or unrelenting, take action immediately.</p>



<span id="more-1203"></span>



<h3>Sulphur or Hard-Boiled Egg Smell</h3>



<p>Here in Canada, natural gas is given a distinct odour so we can recognize when pipes, joints or fittings are leaking. It’s unmistakable because it smells like rotten eggs, or more correctly, sulphur. We do this because natural gas is highly flammable, and we don’t want it floating around in our buildings. Also, it can cause dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and irregular breathing in people and our pets.</p>



<p>In short, if you have a gas-powered furnace that smells like rotten eggs or sulfur, you may have a gas leak. Call your utility provider or an HVAC professional immediately, and follow their instructions. In the meantime, they will rush out with specialized equipment to test the air and track down any leaks.</p>



<h3>Corn Chips or Locker Room Stink</h3>



<p>Locker-room scents&#8211;nobody wants them in their home. These smells can occur when bacteria build up inside your heating system, particularly during shoulder seasons when the system is firing up irregularly here and there. It’s due to condensation accumulating in the system, and though it’s rare in our dry Alberta climate, it does happen. Don’t worry, though, a good, old-fashioned furnace cleaning will sort this out. For tougher cases where the bacteria have migrated into duct work, you can completely eliminate the problem with a full duct cleaning.</p>



<h3>Electrical Burning Smell or Ozone</h3>



<p>This scent is harder to describe, but you’ll know it immediately when you sniff it. It’s a little bit like air in a rainstorm, or burning wires, or an acrid metallic smell. Your furnace might create a similar smell when it overheats.</p>



<p>As furnaces age, their bearings wear out, and these bearings can in turn cause the blower motor to bind or seize. If the unit doesn’t stop working entirely, it could continue to heat, melting wire insulation, and in some cases causing sparks and arcs. If you smell electrical burning, cut the power to your unit immediately and call an HVAC technician for help. This is a serious issue, and [we suggest annual furnace inspections and tune-ups] to check the health of blower motors mainly to avoid this issue altogether.</p>



<h3>Burning or Smoke Smell</h3>



<p>This one is simple. Keep the area around your furnace (and hot water heater) clear of debris. If you smell burning or smoke, be sure to check the surrounding area around your furnace. Be sure to always keep the furnace panel screwed in place as well. That piece of metal is what keeps everything from mice to pets to artifacts from your life from coming into contact with the flames inside your furnace.</p>



<h3>In Short, Trust Your Nose</h3>



<p>If you smell any of the above, don’t hesitate to <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/contact/message.html">call WeatherMakers to perform a furnace inspection</a> or make repairs. If you smell something that’s not on this short list but it seems worrisome, persistent, or it’s just plain annoying, call a pro for a quick inspection. Even if there’s no issue, you’ll have gained peace of mind knowing your furnace is running in peak condition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Furnace, Boiler or Heat Pump?</h2>



<p>So, you’re building or renovating a house or building, and you’re at the point where you have to consider what kind of heating system to use. Your builder or renovator will be an invaluable guide, and knowing a bit about the different types of heating systems, where they work best, and how you’ll be using the spaces, will go a long way in aiding your decision-making.</p>



<span id="more-1090"></span>



<p>Some of the resources you’ll want to consult include master plumbers, if you’re going with a water or radiator-based system, or a heating engineer / experienced HVAC expert if you’re going with forced heat. These experts can be consulted during planning and installation phases, or brought on periodically through all phases to advise on plans, installation and trouble-shooting, or they can work as your heating system contractor, planning, sourcing and overseeing the installation of your system. No matter what, be sure they have worked on many projects similar in size and complexity to your project. Experience is priceless in this field.</p>



<p>So, now that you have your expert, here are some of the things you need to think about:</p>



<ul><li>How will you use the space?</li><li>How much heat do you need and when throughout the day?</li><li>What kind of system will work well for the way you live and the space you’re heating?</li><li>Any quirky or energy-use-related issues about the building?</li><li>Any budgetary restraints?</li></ul>



<p>Do the hard thinking before you plan and install. It will serve you well down the road.</p>



<h2>Types of Heating Systems</h2>



<p>Let’s take a quick look at the most popular types of heating systems and what they’re best-suited for.</p>



<h3><a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces.html">Furnaces</a></h3>



<p>The majority of households in the greater Edmonton area depend on a central furnace for heat. Most of these are powered by natural gas, which is relatively cheap and plentiful, and has an acceptable environmental footprint. This type of system is also easy to install.</p>



<p>Furnaces work by blowing heated air through ducts to rooms throughout the home or building. Inside the guts of the furnace, gas is burned, and the resulting flames warm a metal heat exchanger which transfers that heat to air that is then blown by a fan through the ducts. Combustion products are vented through a flue pipe, and less than 10% of energy is lost through this process.</p>



<p>Some furnaces go the extra mile to reduce wastage. Condensing furnaces take exhaust gases, cool them so the exhaust vapour condenses to water, and that water is then discharged via a plastic pipe.</p>



<p>Note that furnaces and boilers work in a very similar way, but one heats and circulates air and the other heats and circulates water.</p>



<h3><a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/boilers.html">Boilers</a></h3>



<p>Boilers are special-purpose water heaters, and they circulate heated water, which gives off its heat through radiators or other devices throughout a house or building. Cooled water then returns to the boiler to be reheated. Residential boilers typically use natural gas for fuel. Commercial boilers can be steam boilers, distributing steam instead of heated water, which then condenses to water in radiators. Fuels often used are natural gas and rarely, in Alberta, anyway, oil.</p>



<p>As with furnaces, condensing gas-fired boilers are relatively common and significantly more efficient than typical non-condensing boilers.</p>



<h3>Radiant Floor Heating—A Special Kind of Boiler</h3>



<p>Radiant floor heat generally refers to systems that circulate warm water (or other fluids) in tubes under the floor. This warms the floor, which in turn warms a room. It’s a more subtle and ambient system than a furnace and is considered highly efficient depending on the energy sources used. It can be expensive to install and tricky to fix if installation is not done perfectly. It also requires a very experienced system designer and installer and limits your choice of floor finishes.</p>



<h3>Heat Pumps</h3>



<p>Heat pumps are essentially two-way systems that use the temperature difference between a building or house and the ground to swap conditions as desired. Depending on the climate, air-source heat pumps use the outside air as the heat source in winter and a heat sink in summer. Ground-source (also called geothermal, GeoExchange, or GX) heat pumps get their heat from underground, where temperatures are more constant year-round. Air-source heat pumps are far more common than ground-source heat pumps because they are more affordable and easier to install. Ground-source heat pumps, however, are much more efficient, and are frequently chosen by consumers who plan to remain in the same house for a long time, or have a strong desire to live more sustainably.</p>



<h2>Deciding Factors</h2>



<h3>Rating Efficiency</h3>



<p>The efficiency of a fossil-fuel furnace or boiler is a measure of the amount of useful heat produced per unit of input energy (fuel). Combustion efficiency is the simplest measure; it is just the system’s efficiency while it is running. Combustion efficiency is like the miles per kilometre your car gets cruising along on the highway. You’ll want to know and understand these figures when you’re making your decision on the type of system and the fuel sources you choose for that system.</p>



<h3>Installation Costs</h3>



<p>Every system has its pros and cons, so look at initial costs—what it will cost to buy the parts of the system, prep the building to accept the system, and then to install it. The best-planned system is only cost-effective if it’s installed perfectly so it can work at peak efficiency.</p>



<p>Don’t forget running costs. If you have a pump that works off electricity, map out those costs while figuring in a steady annual rise in rates. If your system runs off natural gas, keep in mind it’s a market commodity subject to price volatility. Budget high just in case.<br>Finally, there are projected maintenance costs. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/what-does-a-furnace-tune-up-include/.html">A furnace needs annual maintenance and an inspection </a>but typically requires little outlay over the first 10 years. An in-floor heating system could operate problem-free for years and then suddenly spring a leak. Budget for the worst case scenario and you’ll be OK.<br><a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces.html">Read more about furnaces.</a><br><a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/boilers.html">Learn more about boilers.</a></p><p>The post <a href="/blog/heating-service/types-of-heating-systems-for-alberta-homes-and-buildings/.html">Types of Heating Systems for Alberta Homes and Buildings</a> first appeared on <a href="/blog.html">WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling & Plumbing</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Do I Need a Furnace Tune-Up and Inspection?</span></h2>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from the art on your walls or the cars in your garage, your HVAC system is likely the most expensive equipment you have in your home. Unlike the art and just like your car, your furnace needs a tune-up and look-over every year.&nbsp;</span></p>



<span id="more-1086"></span>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three good reasons to book an annual furnace check.</span></p>



<ol><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some furnace manufacturers will not honour their warranties unless you show them you have had annual maintenance work done on your furnace.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see problems before they become emergencies. Wires snap, igniters burn out, sensors soot up, elements crack and fan motors die. These small parts make up the heart of your furnace, and they all have life expectancies and often give warning signs when they are about to wear out.&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certified furnace technicians have high-tech testing tools to ensure your mechanical equipment is working safely and efficiently. Carbon monoxide is deadly and extremely difficult to detect as it’s colourless and odourless, so properly calibrated equipment can help discover any potentially dangerous issues with your furnace’s venting.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know it’s a hassle to book an annual furnace check, and we try to make it as painless as possible,” says Ian Duke, owner and operator of WeatherMakers for over 25 years. “But this is the one chore I really want to see all homeowners check off their To-Do list every year. It can save a life, save you from a very inconvenient furnace fail, and keep your system operating at peak efficiency.”</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Can I Do in Preparation for a Furnace Tune-up?</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Book an appointment with us at your convenience. We’ll send a certified technician in a fully-stocked truck, and he or she will arrive on time and leave your home as clean as they found it.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Clear any clutter leading to the furnace or around the furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you prefer to use a specific brand or type of filter, have one handy, and our technician will install it before leaving.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Have a list of issues, if any, that you’ve noticed or wondered about with your furnace.&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Do the Technicians Do?</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have three levels of furnace service,” Duke shares. “The first is 24/7 emergency repair&#8211;that’s when the unit makes an unbearable sound or conks out completely. We’ll be there in a jiffy to assess the issue. The second is an inspection, and at WeatherMakers, that’s a 26-point inspection that checks your furnace from top to bottom. It looks at safety and unit integrity. The third is a tune-up, which is an in-depth 56-point check that starts with your furnace and extends to your ductwork and flue pipe. If you pass that, everything is in tip-top shape.”</span></p>



<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if More Repairs Are Needed?</span></h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If large furnace repairs or even a <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/heating/furnaces.html">furnace replacement</a> is necessary, WeatherMakers will discuss the situation with you, prepare an up-front estimate, and work to get you up and running as quickly as possible. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody wants to face a large repair, but if you do, you want to be facing it with us and our expert technicians,” says Duke. <a href="https://weathermakerscomfort.com/blog/time-for-a-new-furnace/.html">Read more about furnace replacements.</a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons to get a new furnace. If your furnace is old or broken, WeatherMakers has a solution for you. Our skilled technicians can perform a <a href="/heating/furnaces.html">furnace inspection</a> or <a href="/heating/furnaces.html">install a new furnace</a> quickly to ensure maximum comfort for your family.</p>



<p>Or maybe you’re tired of paying high utility bills? You may want to upgrade your furnace to reduce your heating costs &#8212; a new furnace can cut your energy costs by up to 30%!</p>



<span id="more-733"></span>



<h3>Furnace Replacement and Installation</h3>



<p>When replacing your furnace, the most important thing to choose is your installer. About half of all new HVAC systems are improperly installed, which means that they do not perform according to their stated efficiency ratings.</p>



<p>The to plan for and <a href="/air-conditioning/air-conditioning-installation.html">install a cooling system</a> or heating system takes a time to learn. Always conduct careful research of your prospective HVAC installer. You may pay less up front for an amateur technician, but you could end up paying much, much more in the long run.</p>



<p>If you want to have a peaceful, comfortable, and happy home, do your homework and find the best HVAC contractor in your area.</p>



<h3>3 Signs You Need to Replace Your Furnace</h3>



<p>No furnace will last forever, but your system will have a longer lifespan if it’s cared for properly. Some furnaces do go out unexpectedly, but in many cases, there are warning signs that indicate a problem.</p>



<p><strong>Constant Running:</strong> If it just can’t keep up, order an inspection so you can learn how much life is left in your furnace. You’ll be surprised how much more efficient today’s furnaces are.<br><strong>Rising Heating Bills:</strong> Any significant changes in costs can indicate a problem. As your furnace ages, efficiency decreases. Compare this year’s bills to ones from a couple of years ago. Having regular tune-ups can help improve your system’s efficiency, but sometimes, the best solution is a new furnace.<br><strong>Frequent Repairs:</strong> It makes sense to have your furnace repaired the first time, but the third, fourth or fifth time? If constant repairs are hurting your budget, it’s probably time to consider a replacement.</p>



<h3>Furnace Brands</h3>



<p>Every brand has its pros and cons. The fact is, there is no “best” brand. While most companies focus on one brand, our purchasing power allows us to work directly with many manufacturers. Our technical knowledge and systems designers understand each brand’s strong and weak points. We use our knowledge to recommend the best system for your home and make sure it is properly sized for maximum energy savings. This knowledge is passed on to you in the form of greater choice, superior warranties, and a system designed specifically for your home and comfort expectations.</p>
