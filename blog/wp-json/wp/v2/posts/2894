It&#8217;s arguably one of the most embarrassing and humiliating experiences to go through, especially when there&#8217;s not much recourse. That&#8217;s where the idea for this blog came from since we pride ourselves on being a reliable, family-owned business in Edmonton. We&#8217;ve even won the prestigious Better Business Bureau 65 Years of Trust Club award which, not to brag, means we know a thing or two about good business practices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the HVAC service industry is riddled with amateurs and scammers who will take advantage of customers. But with our help, you can avoid them and hire only a team of licensed professionals to provide you with <a href=\"\/air-conditioning\/air-conditioning-maintenance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">air conditioning service in Edmonton, AB.<\/a> Relax, take a deep breath, and follow our guide to avoid being scammed in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2>Unlicensed Technicians<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Our technicians are<\/strong> <strong>licensed<\/strong>, which means they&#8217;ve gone through rigorous training to be able to call themselves technicians. These exams and courses are in-depth and help us understand not only how air conditioning systems work, but also how heat pumps work and other technology that&#8217;s up and coming in the HVAC industry. Every technician who is selling their work should be licensed and trained in the relevant industry technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore it&#8217;s a pretty big red flag if you meet an unlicensed technician. Don&#8217;t get us wrong, plenty of retired HVAC technicians have expired licenses and that&#8217;s fine, but anyone without a license who is currently repairing or addressing HVAC system concerns is likely doing so under the table and it could be a scam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Uninsured Work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all reputable HVAC technicians are insured. This means that if something goes wrong on your property, either your HVAC system gets damaged or a technician gets injured for whatever reason, they can file a claim and have that covered without involving the customer. This is a big deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An amateur working on your air conditioner is a big risk. If something happens, you could be the sole person held liable for that damage. An uninsured technician is a risky investment and we&#8217;d go as far as to consider it almost a scam.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Payment Before Work Is Done<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The only time a professional technician will ask for money before work is done is if they require a deposit for a large system installation. These can be multiple thousands of dollars in some cases, so a deposit or prepayment would make sense&#8211;but these are labeled strictly and you receive a receipt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any AC repair technician who asks for payment before any work is done is giving off big red flags. Most often a technician will give customers an estimate so they can know what the cost will be and prepare, but it&#8217;s unprofessional to ask for money before the work is done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go With Your Gut<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You should never feel pressured to choose an HVAC technician, no matter what they say or do. High-pressure sales tactics and conveniently low prices can be hard to deal with, but you should always be comfortable with the work you invest in. Work with our team to feel good from start to finish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"\/contact\/message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Go with WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.<\/a> <em>Ensuring Your Comfort&#8230; For Life!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Relax, take a deep breath, and follow our guide to avoid being scammed in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[70],"tags":[148,139],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2894"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2894"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2894\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2897,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2894\/revisions\/2897"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2894"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2894"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2894"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
