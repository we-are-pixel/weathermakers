This component is very important because it protects sensitive interior systems like wires, burners, and the heat exchanger from getting caked in dust and debris. The air filter isn&#8217;t designed to improve your air quality, but it can also do that as long as you do one simple task:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remember to change it every 1-3 months.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog post is going to focus on the importance of a furnace&#8217;s air filter and how it works to generally keep the components of your system safe and efficient. The longer you go without replacing the air filter, the more likely it is that you&#8217;ll see a rise in heating bills and poor comfort throughout your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you still need to call us for <a href=\"\/heating\/furnaces\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">furnace repairs in Edmonton, AB<\/a> if something goes wrong? Of course! But if there&#8217;s nothing wrong right now, you might be able to stave off those future repairs by replacing the filter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Air Filter Maintenance Matters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The air filter in your furnace is designed to trap dust, debris, and other airborne particles before they circulate through your home. Over time, the filter becomes clogged with these contaminants, restricting airflow. This forces your furnace to work harder to push air through, which not only wastes energy but also reduces the system\u2019s overall performance. A clean air filter ensures your furnace operates efficiently, saving you money on energy bills and extending the life of the system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefits During the Holiday Season<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Improved Indoor Air Quality<\/strong>. The holidays often mean more people in your home, which can stir up additional dust, allergens, and even germs. A clean air filter helps remove these particles from the air, creating a healthier environment for your family and guests. This is especially important if anyone in your home suffers from allergies or asthma.<\/li><li><strong>Reliable Heating for Guests<\/strong>. A clogged filter can lead to furnace malfunctions, which are the last thing you want during a holiday gathering. Replacing the filter reduces the risk of breakdowns, ensuring your home stays warm and welcoming for guests.<\/li><li><strong>Lower Energy Bills During a High-Usage Season<\/strong>. With the furnace running more frequently during colder months, an inefficient system can significantly drive up energy costs. A clean filter allows your furnace to heat your home more effectively, reducing energy consumption and keeping your utility bills in check.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Change Your Air Filter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Replacing an air filter is a quick and easy task. Start by turning off the furnace, locating the filter compartment, and removing the old filter. Check your furnace manual for the correct size and type of replacement filter. Once the new filter is in place, turn the system back on and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with a well-maintained furnace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little maintenance now can go a long way toward ensuring a warm, comfortable, and stress-free holiday season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>For additional help or prompt repairs, <a href=\"\/contact\/message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">contact WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.<\/a> Ensuring Your Comfort&#8230; For Life!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The longer you go without replacing the air filter, the more likely it is that you&#8217;ll see a rise in heating bills and poor comfort throughout your home.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[89],"tags":[142,139,153],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2924"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2924"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2924\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2928,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2924\/revisions\/2928"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2924"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2924"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2924"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
