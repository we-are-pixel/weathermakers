Unlike the art and just like your car, your furnace needs a tune-up and look-over every year.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three good reasons to book an annual furnace check.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some furnace manufacturers will not honour their warranties unless you show them you have had annual maintenance work done on your furnace.<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see problems before they become emergencies. Wires snap, igniters burn out, sensors soot up, elements crack and fan motors die. These small parts make up the heart of your furnace, and they all have life expectancies and often give warning signs when they are about to wear out.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certified furnace technicians have high-tech testing tools to ensure your mechanical equipment is working safely and efficiently. Carbon monoxide is deadly and extremely difficult to detect as it\u2019s colourless and odourless, so properly calibrated equipment can help discover any potentially dangerous issues with your furnace\u2019s venting.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI know it\u2019s a hassle to book an annual furnace check, and we try to make it as painless as possible,\u201d says Ian Duke, owner and operator of WeatherMakers for over 25 years. \u201cBut this is the one chore I really want to see all homeowners check off their To-Do list every year. It can save a life, save you from a very inconvenient furnace fail, and keep your system operating at peak efficiency.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Can I Do in Preparation for a Furnace Tune-up?<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Book an appointment with us at your convenience. We\u2019ll send a certified technician in a fully-stocked truck, and he or she will arrive on time and leave your home as clean as they found it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Clear any clutter leading to the furnace or around the furnace.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> If you prefer to use a specific brand or type of filter, have one handy, and our technician will install it before leaving.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Have a list of issues, if any, that you\u2019ve noticed or wondered about with your furnace.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Do the Technicians Do?<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have three levels of furnace service,\u201d Duke shares. \u201cThe first is 24\/7 emergency repair&#8211;that\u2019s when the unit makes an unbearable sound or conks out completely. We\u2019ll be there in a jiffy to assess the issue. The second is an inspection, and at WeatherMakers, that\u2019s a 26-point inspection that checks your furnace from top to bottom. It looks at safety and unit integrity. The third is a tune-up, which is an in-depth 56-point check that starts with your furnace and extends to your ductwork and flue pipe. If you pass that, everything is in tip-top shape.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if More Repairs Are Needed?<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If large furnace repairs or even a <a href=\"https:\/\/weathermakerscomfort.com\/heating\/furnaces\">furnace replacement<\/a> is necessary, WeatherMakers will discuss the situation with you, prepare an up-front estimate, and work to get you up and running as quickly as possible.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNobody wants to face a large repair, but if you do, you want to be facing it with us and our expert technicians,\u201d says Duke. <a href=\"https:\/\/weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/time-for-a-new-furnace\/\">Read more about furnace replacements.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/weathermakerscomfort.com\/heating\/furnaces\">Learn more about our furnace tune-ups and inspections.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/what-makes-weathermakers-different\/\">Why choose WeatherMakers for your heating needs?<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why Do I Need a Furnace Tune-Up and Inspection?
