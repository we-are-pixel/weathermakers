Left unchecked, even a small leak can lead to mold, structural damage, and higher utility bills. Whether it&#8217;s a small drip or a growing puddle, you need to act fast to prevent water damage and restore your hot water supply.

It\u2019s typically found above the unit. Turn it off to prevent more water from entering the tank and making the leak worse. If the valve is stuck or difficult to reach, you may need to shut off your home\u2019s main water supply instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Turn Off the Power or Gas<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For electric water heaters, switch off the breaker labeled \u201cwater heater\u201d in your electrical panel. If you have a gas model, turn the gas valve to the \u201coff\u201d position. This step is crucial for safety\u2014leaks and electricity or gas don\u2019t mix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Identify the Source of the Leak<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaks can happen for a number of reasons. Some of the most common sources include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Loose drain valves<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Corroded or cracked tank<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>A faulty temperature and pressure relief (T&amp;P) valve<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Leaky plumbing connections<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Carefully inspect the unit. If water is dripping from the top, it could be a fitting. If it\u2019s pooling around the base, it may be the tank itself, especially if it\u2019s over 10 years old.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 4: Drain the Tank<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the leak is significant or the tank is full, draining it can help prevent further water damage. Connect a garden hose to the drain valve at the bottom of the tank and run the hose outside or to a floor drain. Open the valve and allow the tank to empty.<br><br><strong>Important:<\/strong> Be cautious\u2014water inside may still be hot. Let the unit cool before draining if needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 5: Call a Professional<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some minor leaks can be fixed with a quick repair, tightening a valve, or replacing a faulty part. But if the tank itself is corroded or cracked, replacement is likely the only safe and long-term solution. In many cases, calling a professional is the best route to ensure the issue is diagnosed and resolved correctly the first time.<br><br>That\u2019s where we come in.
