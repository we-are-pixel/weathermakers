Rarely do they make sounds beyond that, and when they do, it\u2019s usually a sign that something is wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we don\u2019t want to stress any of our customers out, so we\u2019ll make things as easy as possible. Most issues that give off strange or uncomfortable noises can be fixed by a professional, like the ones on our team. Just schedule an appointment and let us do the rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for everyone who might be a bit curious, vigilance is key. The earlier you can detect an issue in your air conditioner using your ears, the more likely you\u2019ll be to get it taken care of affordably with <a href=\"\/air-conditioning\/air-conditioning-repair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">air conditioning repair in Edmonton, AB.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2>Problematic Sounds<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every sound signifies a problem. Noises like the whooshing of air from the vents and the quick click of the system turning on when the thermostat signals too it, are all signs that the system is working as intended. But the following noises are never good to hear, not even if they\u2019re happening on a mildly warm day compared to a heatwave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Hissing and bubbling. <\/strong>An air conditioner that starts hissing or bubbling is likely leaking refrigerant. This chemical is the lifeblood of your air conditioner and it\u2019s required for the system to work effectively. Without refrigerant, your air conditioner basically becomes an oversized fan.<\/li><li><strong>Grinding. <\/strong>An air conditioner that\u2019s grinding is likely having issues with the compressor. This component consumes the most electricity and is responsible for pressurizing the refrigerant. This is never a good sign and requires repairs immediately.<\/li><li><strong>Clanking or rattling. <\/strong>Clanking or rattling can often correspond to a component that is loose or a screw that\u2019s come apart. This might not sound like a bad issue, but that loose component can bump into one that\u2019s sensitive and expensive, leading to further issues down the line.<\/li><li><strong>Constant clicking. <\/strong>A click for the system to start up or turn off is normal. But multiple clicks can insinuate that your air conditioner has an issue with the capacitors.<\/li><li><strong>Buzzing. <\/strong>Like the last problem, buzzing can also indicate a problem with your air conditioner\u2019s electrical components. Frayed wires, burnt out components, and even an issue with the thermostat can lead to buzzing.<\/li><li><strong>Squealing. <\/strong>A loose fan motor belt can easily cause the system to start squealing. Don\u2019t neglect this issue just because it\u2019s coming from the fan of your system, it still needs to be fixed before it breaks.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, only a licensed professional has what it takes to address these issues head-on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"\/contact\/message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Schedule an appointment<\/a> with WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.
