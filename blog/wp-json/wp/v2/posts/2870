Repairs imply that your air conditioner is in okay shape <em>to begin with<\/em>. But air conditioners that are either too old, too broken, or too inefficient are often not worth the repair cost and are not what we would consider <em>in good shape<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you know if your air conditioner is on its way out? The signs aren&#8217;t always obvious, and it might require some digging, but there is an answer out there. We will help you get to the bottom of this conundrum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember&#8211;you can&#8217;t avoid <a href=\"\/air-conditioning\/central-air-conditioners\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">central AC replacement in Edmonton, AB.<\/a> Every AC has a lifespan limit and will need to be replaced eventually.

AC systems run for the majority of a hot day, which means they&#8217;re consistently using electricity. The less electricity they use, the less they cost month-to-month, which directly impacts your bills. But efficiency can also be a metric to determine whether your system is on its way out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your air conditioner costs too much to run, or it&#8217;s started running less efficiently on a regular basis, then it could be due to multiple components being worn down. A system replacement can alleviate this problem easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Constant Problems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One or two problems can usually be fixed with prompt repairs. But constant problems, like a repair call every single year, can usually signal that it&#8217;s time for your air conditioner to be replaced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about it this way&#8211;keeping this AC unit is just going to be more frustrating in the future as you continue to call for repairs. A newer AC with all new components is going to last for a long time and likely won&#8217;t need nearly as many repairs in the first few years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It Doesn&#8217;t Keep You Comfortable<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Does your air conditioner do a poor job of meeting the demand set on your thermostat? Then regardless of what&#8217;s wrong, you might want to think about replacement. AC systems should be sized and installed according to your preferences and the size of your home. If it can&#8217;t meet the cooling demand, then something is seriously wrong that might not be fixable with simple repairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 10-15 Year Age Range<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is simple&#8211;air conditioners are only meant to last 10-15 years. Beyond this range, all bets are off and you could see costs rise substantially from inefficiency to increased repairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It Just Doesn&#8217;t Work at All!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This might seem like a no-brainer, but a lot of customers will still try to repair an air conditioner that just doesn&#8217;t turn on at all. This might make sense if the system is still relatively new and the problem is just a simple component failure, but most of the time with older systems, the root of the problem has to do with its age and multiple component failures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what we would consider a <strong>full system breakdown<\/strong> and something that can often warrant an entire replacement. It&#8217;s an unfortunate thing to be surprised by, but it&#8217;s better than trying to get it fixed repeatedly with no lasting results!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"\/contact\/message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Schedule a replacement<\/a> with the experts at WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing. <em>Ensuring Your Comfort&#8230; for life!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every AC has a lifespan limit and will need to be replaced eventually.
