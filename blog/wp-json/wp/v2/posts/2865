Nope, we&#8217;re talking to any homeowner who has a central air conditioner, heat pump, or even a ductless mini split. Every single one of these systems has an air filter that needs to be cleaned on a regular basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the best part is? <strong>We don&#8217;t need to be the ones to clean it. You can clean your air filter whenever you want.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, this isn&#8217;t a typical blog about hiring a professional for <a href=\"\/air-conditioning\/air-conditioning-maintenance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AC maintenance in Edmonton, AB<\/a> or scheduling a diagnosis with an expert. This is a bit of maintenance that you can do right now, and we&#8217;d argue, homeowners should be doing it on a very regular basis to avoid problems down the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to learn more about this component? Keep reading and we&#8217;ll get to the bottom of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2>What the Air Filter Does<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The air filter is an interesting component in your air conditioner. Technically, it&#8217;s in your air ducts and not your AC unit, but it still counts as one of its most important components.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The air filter blocks our harmful contaminants like dust, debris, and pet dander. These contaminants are harmless to us (albeit uncomfortable to live with), but they can be extremely detrimental to your air conditioner and the cooling process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The air filter keeps them from gunking up the coils and causing issues over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Problems With a Clogged Filter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What kinds of issues can a clogged air filter cause? Here are a few:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Poor efficiency and increased energy consumption.<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Uncomfortable temperatures and a reduction in the AC&#8217;s effectiveness.<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Poor air quality.<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Wear and tear.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these problems can come with an increased likelihood of a system breakdown and other issues that require professional repair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Changing the Filter: A Guide<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We could get really detailed with this kind of guide, but you&#8217;ll likely find that stuff in video form throughout the rest of the internet. We&#8217;d like to keep it short and simple while also reminding you that <strong>our team can walk you through this process when you schedule maintenance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let&#8217;s get right to it. How do you change your air filter?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Locate the <strong>return air duct<\/strong> which funnels air into your air conditioner. This system should be marked with an arrow, or at least labeled correctly so you can find it.<\/li><li>There should be a flap which, when lifted, allows you to remove the air filter that is currently placed within the system.<\/li><li>Make sure you <strong>turn your air conditioner off before you remove the filter.<\/strong><\/li><li>Go ahead and remove the filter.<\/li><li>If the filter is reusable (i.e. plastic or some kind of durable material), then you can clean it off with a damp paper towel. Make sure it dries afterward.<\/li><li>If the filter is disposable, you can just throw it out and replace it with a new one.<\/li><li>When this is complete, just place the new filter back into the slot where the old one was. Try to make sure it&#8217;s facing the correct direction when doing so.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, turn your air conditioner back on and enjoy the comfort!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>You can always trust WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing&nbsp;to help walk you through the air filter changing process. <a href=\"\/contact\/message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Schedule an appointment with us today.<\/a> <em>Ensuring Your Comfort&#8230; For Life!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to learn more about this component?
