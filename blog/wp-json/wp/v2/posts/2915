After all, why pay attention to air ducts when your heating system usually takes center stage as the unit that <em>actually<\/em> creates the heat you feel. And even when your ducts are clean, you don&#8217;t want to see them or be around them since they sit in dark corners and basements while you get to enjoy the beautiful rooms of your house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s true that air ducts tend to get neglected. But luckily there&#8217;s an easy service you can sign up for that gets your air ducts cleaned and prepared for the next few years. We&#8217;re talking about <a href=\"\/indoor-air-quality\/duct-cleaning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">duct cleaning in Edmonton, AB.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When our experts provide duct cleaning, we root out any contaminants, mold infestations, caked-in dust, and dirt layers, and ensure your air ducts are not contributing to poor air quality or inefficiency. Let&#8217;s talk about why duct cleaning is just a good idea for the fall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Duct Cleaning Is Important<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Air ducts are a vital part of your home comfort system. They help to transport the heated or cooled air from your centralized HVAC system to the rooms in your house. When you see vents everywhere, those vents are just the tail end of the ductwork system, they&#8217;re just one tiny part of a large network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now that we know how important air ducts are, you can probably start to understand why their cleanliness is also important. If you&#8217;re having air transported through this network every day, then having that air get disrupted by dust, dirt, pet dander, and even pest droppings can cause immense problems for your health and efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s impossible to tell what&#8217;s in your air ducts ahead of time since we don&#8217;t recommend customers open them up to look inside. But if you haven&#8217;t had your ducts cleaned in some time, then we recommend getting this work done as a routine courtesy so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it for a few years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>&#8220;Can I Clean My Ducts on My Own?&#8221;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a good idea. We understand the enthusiastic sentiment of trying to get something done by yourself, and <strong>cleaning<\/strong> sounds like the easiest thing for a homeowner to do. But this is not normal cleaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is akin to cleaning the inside of your car&#8217;s engine or the inside of your computer system. The components are extremely delicate and specific tools are required to clean them properly. Trying to do this without any training or expertise will lead you to the possibility of not getting the job done in its entirety or causing damage that needs repairs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>This Lasts for a While<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to talk about the investment in duct cleaning? It might seem like it&#8217;s not worth it, but it lasts for a long time. Unless you live in very unique circumstances, our duct cleaning appointments are thorough and can last for years so you don&#8217;t have to think about it again for a long while.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><a href=\"\/contact\/message\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Schedule this service with WeatherMakers Heating, Cooling &amp; Plumbing.<\/a> Ensuring Your Comfort&#8230; For Life!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When our experts provide duct cleaning, we root out any contaminants, mold infestations, caked-in dust, and dirt layers, and ensure your air ducts are not contributing to poor air quality or inefficiency.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[79],"tags":[151,139],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2915"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2915"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2915\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2918,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2915\/revisions\/2918"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2915"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2915"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.weathermakerscomfort.com\/blog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2915"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
