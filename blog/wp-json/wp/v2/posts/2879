They don\u2019t use air ducts, as the name implies, and they run at peak efficiency levels that customers are just now discovering, which means they can save big on their energy bills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ductless systems have a ton of unique advantages and reasons for an initial purchase. But they\u2019re not a one-size-fits-all solution for everyone. For reasons that we\u2019ll get into below, a <a href=\"\/air-conditioning\/ductless-systems\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ductless HVAC system in Edmonton, AB<\/a> is only going to be good for certain customers, and a more conventional system like a ducted heat pump or a central air conditioner might be a better choice for others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you know which category you fit into? Let\u2019s figure it out together!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<h2>The Pros of a Ductless System<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the best part. If you\u2019ve done even a little bit of research on ductless systems and think they might be perfect for your home, then you\u2019ll be excited to hear about some of these perks they offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>No ducts, no problems. <\/strong>As we mentioned earlier, ductless HVAC systems don\u2019t need ducts. This is a big deal since smaller homes usually don\u2019t have room for ducts, and duct installation can be expensive on its own.<\/li><li><strong>Superb efficiency. <\/strong>Since ductless systems don\u2019t use air ducts, they don\u2019t risk leaking any air, which means 100% of the treated air ends up right where you can feel it. This maximizes their efficiency and makes them cost less over time.<\/li><li><strong>Customized comfort. <\/strong>Each air handler can be set to a different temperature threshold, meaning your bedroom can be a different temperature than your kitchen or living room.<\/li><li><strong>Heat pump technology. <\/strong>Since they\u2019re heat pumps, ductless systems can function as cooling and heating units, giving you year-round comfort.<\/li><li><strong>They continue to work when there\u2019s a problem. <\/strong>When one air handler breaks down, you can rest assured knowing that the others will continue to work while you get that one fixed.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Cons of a Ductless System<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks to a ductless system. But the good news is that there are other HVAC systems that can solve these problems easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Higher investment cost. <\/strong>Ductless systems do end up costing more to install than other conventional heating or cooling systems, like central air conditioners or furnaces. But this takes into account the fact that they are two systems in one.<\/li><li><strong>They have a particular aesthetic. <\/strong>Some people just don\u2019t like the look of air handlers mounted on the wall or ceiling.<\/li><li><strong>They require consistent maintenance. <\/strong>Ductless heat pumps require maintenance twice a year in order to remain as efficient as they should be.<\/li><li><strong>Electricity prices can affect monthly costs<\/strong>. If electricity is expensive where you live, then it could cost more to run per month. But this is true for any air conditioning system.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making the Right Call<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team can work with you to ensure that your home gets the perfect solution you\u2019re happy with.
